Why?
There.
Wow
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Like you care.
What?
You did what?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
What about him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
A hundred bucks a date.
It's about time.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
What'd he say?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
BIANCA
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
The duck?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
What's to discuss?
Have a great time, honey!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
The Judgment is ours!
I don't want you to wait for me.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
How far from here?
I'm not bargaining!
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Chief says -- how many?
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
God... That's in a week!
What are you saying?
I suppose we're both old men now.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Thank you.
Where can I meet this man?
We're lost!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
So you were never a prostitute?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
What are you doing?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
My folks are.
Two heads.
Of course.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
How many victims are up there?
Alright?
Yeah.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
You promise?
Okay.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
Where is escort service?
How long are you planning to stay?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Emil???!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
I speak English.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
What are you coming here to do?
What was that?
He's my collar!
Oh yeah, why?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
CONTINUED
Okay. 
Yes.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, I thought so.
Well, that's something.
Good morning. How's it going?
Hal?
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Are you coming to my party?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Where's ganz?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Hey, you wanna bet?
What are you talkin' about?
Must be billy's girl.
They saved your ass, convict.
How much?
Right, partner.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Hey, there she is...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
When? How?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
That's the way I see it, too.
Thanks for the coffee.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
She's an exception..
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Of course.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
And then?
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Who?
How do I look?
Hello?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Eto Akta Gamat!
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I've had enough good news for today
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Cornelius..
Love...
Finished what?
Learning language.
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Not going to open?
Been here long?
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
This thing solid?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Drink!
Am I disturbing you?
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Tom...
Anything harder?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
I'm camera shy.
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Look, I don't know what this...
Call me Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I don't know...
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Big date tonight?
Remember me?
Snuff films.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
I'm a working stiff, pops.
What's next?
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I'm afraid I don't...
No.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
Okay, I follow you so far...
How are you?  Having any luck?
Yes, but...
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who is this... ?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
You don't get it, he's after me...
But how...?
The tickets.
Very funny.
You disappointed in me?
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Are you alright?
But how are we gonna --
I've got to write some of this down.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Cyclops?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Is there any way out of it?
Excuse me, Skipper---
Anything ---
All ready?
Who with?
Why?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Hmm.
What happened?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Bastard's got his high beams on.
To us it was.
Are we going in this?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
What's the hurry?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Yeah.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
Yeah, lots.
I still don't understand --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
Forget it.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Take care, Wade.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Bang!
Crawl!
You think Jack shot him?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How you doing, sweetie?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
It's cut.
You read my mind.
How we doing, Colonel?
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Do you have to be so brutal?
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Jim...
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
The fax machines.
who can I say is calling?
I might still have a few chips left.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Dunn.
Ted, what's wrong?
Who's that, Ted?
Not now, Elaine!
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
I'd use the word insane.
Not now, Elaine.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Have you got it straightened out now?
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Negative.
What?
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
No. I'm all alone.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Ted, what are you doing here?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Yes?
We'd better get back now.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
How ya doing, honey?
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
You okay?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Uh, Matthew...
This is mole.  It's good.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
To the... to the beach?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
We all did.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Only holds five.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Ss'kya'ta'.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Position?
Can't lock up...
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Now, wait a second --
Well you're not reading it right!
They're in the approach corridor.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
What's this?
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Ellen.
It's inside the complex.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
So what do I tell this guy?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
I don't want you for a friend.
No, it's different, honey.
Can we dream?
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Well, what does it matter to you?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Don't bother.
No, she's fine.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Yes!
No! No! No!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Oh, leave me alone.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
You're not going to do this?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Come back tonight.
He needs me, ma'am.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
I see that you're expecting.
He's adorable!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
What a strange young man.
Really?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Don't you have a maid?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Good morning, sir.
Why? What has happened?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Wolfi!
What?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I'm sorry. No.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Really?
Ah!
Did you like it, then?
I'm afraid not.
Ah. Italian?
What exactly are you working on?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Really? Why?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
Finish what?
Of course.
Confutatis Maledictis.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Yes.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
That's wonderful!
You go fast!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Oh? Have I seen it?
Exactly.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Who is on this committee?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Where?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Well, promise then.
Yes, I am looking after him.
I'll call tomorrow.
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor?
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Twenty-eight.
What? Oh, yes, please.
Yes, go on.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
That's easy enough.
Closet.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Do me an enormous favor?
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
He all right?
Chart says he's from New York.
Lunatic?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Jack.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Nice looking group.
What do you think was wrong?
Say, David...
I heard that.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Shit! David, what is that?
Plan?
It sounds far away.
You really scared me, you shithead.
I can't stand it.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
It's you, David.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Jack, are you really dead?
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Dr. Hirsch?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
No kidding?
Charlie!
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
What about?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
What?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
What's this?
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Now?
I'm listening.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
The theatre?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Oh, ten dollars—
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
It couldn't have been earlier?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Dammit!
Bob, rip up some bandages.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Then why can't I go in there?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Such as?
That would have made an impression.
Web's dead.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
What do you think?
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Oh yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I don't understand.
I beg your pardon?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You cocky little bastard.
Thank you.
I swear.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
How can that be?
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
How did you know?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
I can't believe this.
Nice?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Pull out.
Take it off.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Do...what.
We should do it.
I don't want to talk about it.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He's rich.
We need to talk.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Yes, I am.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Where are you going?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
How did you guess?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
What...is...it?
Patrick?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
After six.
I'll do it.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
No, not really.
What's that?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
...to the office this afternoon.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You're at Paul Owen s.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
No, I guess it's okay.
Do you feel that way?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
No.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
But Marcus denied it?
I'm hungry.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Oh well, you know.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
They hack into people's programs?
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
You can't just walk in, either.
Great!
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Milo?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
...When did you know?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
He's pretty tight with his family.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
Wait... He knows.
You do?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
...Milo?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Time?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
What're they building?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
You seem surprised to see me.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Good luck, Austin.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
I'm sorry?
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
I hate having my picture taken.
I'm sorry.
Of course, luv.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Dr. Evil?
What is it now?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I'm proud of you.
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
... bottle ...
How long have I been here?
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
I have an appointment.
How curious ...
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
I'm already married ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Valentine, listen to me ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Choices?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
And I suppose you're the knight.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Is that written in his shoe?
Is there anything that isn't?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Where am I?
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
To kill me?
No trouble.
Yes ... ?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
I thought you didn't.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
What's that you're wearing?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Decontamination -- ?
I see.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Surveillance? By whom?
Who's now vanished.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
You with Mother or Father?
Both, actually.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
You said ... one shot.
You are, and it's behind you.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
That's what we're going to find out...
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
I've decided not to run for President.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Great car.
Maybe it had something to do.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Mr. Thomerson.
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
But a fabulous cook.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I don't believe you.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Really?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
The phone made me do it!
Olivier's in that, right?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
How'd it go?
Very.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- Knock it off!
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
You gotta let me finish --
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Thanks.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
It's okay, Stephen, I --
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Anything else?
You look great.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hey.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
What is --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
The outlets.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
What?
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Your brother was a good man.
Four months.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
I'll be there.
Where's Sean?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
-- You remember.
I treated you better.
And old ladies?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Inspector.
I'm a little busy right now --
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
What's to believe?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
You took the chalice.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Are you all right, honey?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
Yes, Sister?
You truly are a dancing fool.
What's your name?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
I'm not smiling.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Meaning?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
My tap shoes.
How you sound?
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
You lost me.
What point is that?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
What is your problem?
You've said that already.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
So you have your small victory, now what?
I thought it was appropiate.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
You feel good, not nervous?
I don't believe it.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, your father called.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
I never had a really real pair before.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You sing and dance?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
I thought you got rid of...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
...yes she did.
Around...
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
What?
You leave something out?
Say what, Manray?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Where are you bound for?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
You want my heart?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Agreed.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
By name only.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Yeah, right...
Why not?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
And he'd been shot.
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Jesus, what happened?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Where have you been, Jay?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
If not you, then who?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
What don't you know?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
I don't know --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You're drunk --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
I didn't shoot West...
What?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Think it'll work?
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Your phone number?
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
Pike and I got separated --
So you took off your shirt?
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
What the fuck happened to you --
I used it to start the fire --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Who is she? Where does she live?
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Will.
Eighteen.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
I like your stories.
Really?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
The one about the witch.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
She was a witch.
You owe me three-fifty.
I will.
What?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Where are we headed?
Wait! I need those!
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
But it's not true.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
What for?
The sets were good.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
What's this?
Do you like it?
What?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Right.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Oh nothing.
You can stay tonight.
He wants the money from your bank.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
What?
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Okay. Thank you.
Just wanted to see.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Angela?
Yes?
You take her to a doctor?
That'd be nice.
At church?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
For your hands?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
You wanna go home?
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Well I don't...
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Why you got me chained?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
I said... STOP!
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Don't think that'd be wise.
What I love.
Why you say that?
What'chu sayin'?
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Please don't tell my daddy.
I skipped lunch.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Holy shit!
I feel better. Do you?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
The hell you call me?
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Maybe we should do something?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Short shift?
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Why weren't you at the platform?
Did I say that?
Nick...
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
No.
Why's that?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
You'll get Ich killed.
No one's keeping him here.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
Could you fill me in?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Let's go while there is still time.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Also extraordinary things.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
What's going on down there?
When?
I was just about to have my dinner.
I didn't like her.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
How do I stop one?
Shot of vodka, please.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
No.  I got a problem.
No rust?
What if you change your mind?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
What shows?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
It would be my child.
What do you want me to do?
Where is he?
How come you're not on the job?
They could clean around the arrangement.
What's a long time?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What difference will it make?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
She didn't know?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Beautiful.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
You're lost?
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Yes, I'm right?
Do you own a car?
Yes.
Take it. damn it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
What's the pay?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Then forget it.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Of course.
Get out!
Yes, ma'am!
You almost got us killed!
Yes!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
I thought I was here to meet women.
No way.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Adam?!
What?
...I do.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
But, I don't understand.
You're sure?
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Right on the button.
1959.
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Why not? He has great pants.
Why did you park way back there?
What?!
You bet!
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
I don't see anything!
Hello.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I'm afraid you've got to.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
You got a light, honey?
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
What?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
So where is your roommate, the model?
Give me your hand.
Well, that's blunt!
That water's freezing!
What's that mean?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
To bed.
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Yes, you do!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
To get some frozen poultry.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
Is Sandy part of this?
Only you and the photo lab.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
No.
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Don't say that.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh shit.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Come in.
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'll call you.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Look at these. What are these?
Those are my breasts.
Hey? You like to walk.
What time are visiting hours?
God, you scared me.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
That sounds good.
What's with Mike?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
You like mysteries that much?
Let's wait for some slow one.
My father has a gun at home.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Yes mother.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
What?! What are you doin'?
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
We... met them last night.
We paid attention in school.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
That was way easier than I thought.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Rule of thumb?
Yeah?
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
No way they could have seen it?
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Who the...
Twist of lemon!
How many bodies, Greenly?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Yes.
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
That sets it off.
What do you think?
See if mine are in there.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Inez, this is --
They don't?
Where was it parked?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Don't panic, Anthony.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
What is it?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Do you like Inez?
What's happening? What's going on?
Come on.
Like amnesia.
I'm not kidding.
You're living on a sailboat?
Does it float?
That's a sharp jacket.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Me?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
Who?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
See you.
What?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Let's not even talk about it.
Give him a second.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
What?  What?
You're Anthony?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
I don't know about that.
Yes. I did.
It's true, Dignan.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
That's too bad.
Did we get it?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Yes, I do.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Scarecrow?
Everything OK?
Wait a second --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
You keeping out of trouble?
I'm trying.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Is he good?
Why?
Where did he go?
You a good pool player.
There was a mistake.
That's not gonna fly.
And what are we looking for?
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
No. You lost your way.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
What do you want?
I don't know.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
-- car keys?
The Telegraph office.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I love you, too.
But you found another choice.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
A Russian?
That's a lie!
Why am I alive?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
What? The tapes?
This is everything? Is there.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
If you say so.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Are we hacking or asking?
Peace?!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
When will his trial be?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
Where is my son?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Let her speak.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I do not confess.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
I'm not just saying it!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
You have... you have a husband.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
I... I blacked out.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Straight up.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
I deserve a lot worse.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Know what?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
I don't get it.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
...yes.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Just get out, didja?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Rick?
And the other alternative?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
That's too far ahead to plan.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You can believe that if you want to.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
For the last time, put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
And Laszlo?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
No, not yet.
No.
But what about us?
Yes.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Our faithful friend is still there.
No, Victor, there isn't.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Hello, Rick.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Had a close one, eh?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
No. It's all arranged.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
And that is?
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
This is the end of the chase.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Why two?
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Oh, no, Rick never --
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Sam's piano.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Where were you last night?
Make it official, if you like.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Put that phone down!
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
For how long?
I don't want them here overnight.
I like it fine here.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
No.
Uh, my watch stopped.
What's that you're playing?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Get water!
What are you doing?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
They're on autopilot.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
As much as anybody.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Cold.
Hey, look at you.
You can't go now.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
If I'd known you were alive --
I am one lucky guy.
Need some help?
You're Chuck Noland.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Thought you were going to bring her.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
You were how long on this?
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
To life.
Permission granted.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
You weren't dreaming about me.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
What's the *medical* explanation?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
Please don't make me say it again.
I'm okay--I can walk.
That's true.
That's a heavy sedation.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Is *your* father dead?
*Liver* killed him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's an immigrant?
Uh... it's the end of October.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
What about the trees?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
I am not a doctor.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
So what?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
That's it.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Sort of like a letter of intent.
We had to finalize the deal.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
I can see why you liked her.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
I told you, use less powder.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
I have a good crew.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
No thanks. I'm good.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
It's more than that.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you know I will?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
We're working for the King.
Uh...
Is it all fugasi?
My fucking heart bleeds.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What happened?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Then who's the Banker?
I can handle it.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Special Agent?
You guys awake?
Maybe another time.
You called the casino a cesspit.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about fifteen hundred?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
I found her in bed with someone.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Last hand.
Not particularly.
And your lady?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I. sold the car.
I've got something to tell you.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Gambling's not about money.
Nothing about you.
What?
I want to buy a car.
I've lived there.
So why did you come to my casino?
Just an accident. Nothing.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
How much do you owe?
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
What for?
Is it yes?
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
I'm Lucy.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
No thanks.
I was at Beadles.
Why four? And not three or five?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
How?
Does he win?
The key!
Key?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is fun.
And you can only do it once, right?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Any planets?
Any of 'em any good?
What are you gonna name it?
-- open circuit breakers --
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
I like it up here.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Sorry.
How I make my living, what's your point?
What?
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Leave.  Now.
How're ya doin', Max.
You mean until you showed up?
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
Same old story.  Not interested.
What're you looking for?
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
Your help.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
Well, not me personally.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Who are you?
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Say the words, "I understand."
Thank you.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
How long you and me known each other?
She's got my word.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
We gotta talk.
You left out condescending.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
No problem.
Beth? I can't believe it.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
What's it worth to you?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
You got in the car, didn't you?
What are you, high?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
But, mom!
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
Good morning...
GOOD MORNING!
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Where did you come from?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
How much longer is this gonna last?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Wow. Did he go to jail?
You mean soap?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
With, like, images?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
We're moving through time.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Did you call the cops?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
What else makes you feel regret?
Frank is going to kill.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Why would I tell Mom?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
What I think is going on with your son.
He was a year ahead of us?
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Okay.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Yes...
Okay... well, bye.
So? Be real easy.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Gladys! Stop it!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Yes, sir. 
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
She did.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Go ahead.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Uncle, you can't do this!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
One or two?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
You don't own this man!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Tell me about it, please!
Is he... dying then?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
y-y-yes--
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
What's this?
My name is...
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Righteousness...
The hospital?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's your fantasy...
I said welcome.
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
But --
REALLY?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
I don't suppose... no...
What?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
I met this girl...
It's magic.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
Weren't we supposed to?
Well, what else do we do?
Sven!
What's all the panic about?
What do we have to do?
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Your lord.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
What?
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
YOU do it!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
I must KILL! Kill!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Thanks, guys.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I remember.
May I help you?
Okay, I guess.
How are you today?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Probably see you at the book store.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
You pick it.
Oh, yeah.
Tomorrow?
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Where are you going?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
No.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
Yeah.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Okay.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Yeah.
When?
I think I should go back.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Doesn't sound like me.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
What took you so long?
How's it going?
I just got in.
That's me.
I should maybe talk to you.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Hi.
Definitely!
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
No way. I can handle this.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
What do you want, Stan?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
He went home sick.
Mary. What are you doing here?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
The voltage looks fine.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
About...
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
No, I guess not.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Thanks.
So now you're bummin' around?
Hitchhiking?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Will it work?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
What's happening...?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Can anybody hear me...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
It's complicated...
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
I don't know...
You... You can't do that!
I'm not the Devil.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
It is now.  We're locked in.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Where is it, where is it...
Carbon dioxide?
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Blow it up?
He's been past Mars?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
It's cold.
Where is she?
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
How?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Five times.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Ben. Are you okay?
Where... where am I?
Reed?... Sue?
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Sweet.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Which was?
What? What do you mean you --
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
What are you doing?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
I can... make it work.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Something happened to them, mon.
First door on your left!
This is how I dress all the time.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Why can't you do it?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Well... it's true.
See you later.
No.
Yes, sir.
Leave me alone!
Jeff you have company!
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Did you get her number?
No.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Yeah?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How often do you go?
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Should we buy a frame for that?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Well I never did it.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
No. But it's a nice idea.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Dartmouth?!
What class?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
What's that?
What about those other guys you live with?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
No. That's okay.
Do you really have to go?
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Are you ready to order here?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Naw!
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Really?
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
Where's the medicine?
Shoot it.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I think I know where a CB is.
And that's how I ended up here.
What tunnel? Where?
You all sure about this?
Scared?
What now, Geronimo?
We're going to get help.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
How much you got to see the show?
He's dead.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Will these boards hold?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Nine?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Go! Go!
You know you don't have to do this.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Good, good. Give them that.
Huh.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Where's Clifford?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Harry!
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Good.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Are you an actor?
Are you really serious? About acting?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
What?
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Don't start, Farmer.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Calm down, Frances.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
What's that?
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Huh?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Who?
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
No.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
The speech? Real good.
Yes, Ma.
Where are you going?
Mama...?
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
And what's that?
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Nice.
Better that way... for me.
Why?
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
This was not taken from a grave.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
I've loved you all my life
Our decision. Together.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Are you having me on?
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
You're making a scene!
Yes? And?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
For what?
What happened up there?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
You draw very well.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
How come you're leaving?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
What is it?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Don't call him.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph.
You okay?
Anything else you want?
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
That's thirty percent.
So let's do it.
Why do you want to stop?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
What about Kate?
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Come again?
Is this real?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Yes.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I'm going for 'em!
No!
What you said to me in the room.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- you got your microwave --
Whatsamatter?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Best in Mexico.
How's it feel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Where's the woman?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
They broke when you fell.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Wow...
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Oh, really.
Straight up?
Then good night.
So I'll get a fair shot?
See me, sir?
Entering my scan now...
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
What changed?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Just a coincidence?
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Me?  Why me?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I don't know, I don't care.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
Just askin'
'Cool?
Maybe half.  Not even.
Say again, sir?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Say again?  How many micks?
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Subject?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I take it this file is still open.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Where's Audrey?
I like that image.
That why you dumped him?
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Circuits are overloaded.
How do you know?
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Did you talk with Humphries?
Call me Charlie.
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Really? A girlfriend then?
Where's Luc and Pierre?
It's Tatopoulos.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you looking for this?
Sounds like a big company.
Oh.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
What's with the chewing gum?
How do I do that?
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
He wants to THINK!?
You have a better plan, Alex?
You could order something in.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Shit! Go!
That's It?
Yes?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Your last name.
More to the left... Stay parallel...
~e're alive!
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Are they behind us?
You're playing your good side.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Thank God. Are you okay?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
Unbelievable.
Closer?  I can try.
Yes.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We.. We lie.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
A model, only as big as this.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Do your best, Tommy...
Anything.
Okay... On what?
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
WHAT? WH
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Misunderstood what!?
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
Are you going to keep him, sir?
I'm not sure.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
They help me understand why we fight.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
I only meant...
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
But, you do come from a military family?
You know very well who it is that I love.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Or, 'civilized'.
Then why are you teaching me...?
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
I say!
I see...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Juba was a Numidian.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
So... how many movies you been in?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
What three hundred grand?
What?
Who the fuck are you?
You're an investor, is that it?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
That's what I'm doing.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Not really.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So what's the problem?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Who?
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
One we're producing.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
How about this?
Compass.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
What're you doing here?
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Right. See how your story ends.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Sounds fair.
Depends, who pays?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Really.
What? You sure?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
What?
Maureen.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Did you?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
What's this?
The right way and the wrong way.
Hard to say.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Sounds like the hull.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
How do you mean?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Stay away. Or else.
Why not call for help?
Epps.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
What do you think happened on this boat?
The what?
Epps, over.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Of course they did.
Yeah.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Can't find the shotgun.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Guess.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Who is this, Enid?
Did you actually do this painting?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Help me what?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
That guy rules!
Aren't there a million places like this?
Hi Josh.
Why?
When did I say I hated you?
Yeah, well --
Okay... I promise.
God, what a bunch of retards...
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Hi, Al!
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Does Oomie really like this show?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
Why do I always have to do it?
I want to "make love" to him.
Oh yeah...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
I totally, totally hate you.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Where?
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
God, you're really obsessed...
Look, we have to get these...
Just some people from work...
He came into work.
It's fine.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Indian records?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I don't think so...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Yeah, but still...
Never...
Boo!
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
In whatever way you think I mean.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
What about Joe?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
God, Dana's going to kill you!
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
She's not at home?
Why? What did she tell you?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Am I to take it you want to live?
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
Starling?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
What?
Understand, I had help-
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Shhh.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Why?
I am also liaison between these two.
For you.
Why so many?
Janosz?
What do you want with my baby?
Everybody has a choice.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
What do you think?
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Too bad for the Moldavians.
Yes, the scourge --
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Is the line sinking?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
No, I just thought --
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Uuuuuuugh!!
Is it a star?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
You heard it?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Do you want this body?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Really!  Is it gone?
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I want you to have this. 
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Has this ever happened before?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
That's "Peck!"
Circle?
Nervous?
Two wavy lines?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Something was definitely here.
Don't cross the beams.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Who?
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Where are you, Pete?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Those are priceless sculptures.
If I may be so bold...
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
That's difficult to say, general.
Caesar?
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Where is my father?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
Why do you play at being drunk?
Would that Marcus had lived.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
You brought the army into Rome.
He's very realistic.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Then get a large cash advance.
Before they leave, get gold.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Do you?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
I'm meeting someone.
Yes.
I don't understand --
Why?
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
What are you looking for?
No.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Oh no. He said that.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
You're not one of those agitators?
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin?
Where are you?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
Oh no.
Is it a girl?
Is what a girl?
Drink?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
How are you?
He didn't see me.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Who said it was my first time?
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Go ahead then.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
No we don't.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Why not?
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
May I stay then?
Drive down the block.
What have you done to her?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
What about it?
Say that again.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Sir?
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Why?
That's quite a statement.
What's happening?
The pearls are in her room.
No --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I've quit.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
You were very different yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
What do you want here?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Strange man...
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone --
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
And now?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Not at all, sir. 
Then you know him?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
The Baron is tired?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
For me?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
What...! --
Not too quickly.
Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Why not?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
What?
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Hurry, Suzette.
There was -- there was.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Again?
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
I don't know you.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
-- We must do something...
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Four minutes past. Please come.
Have I kept you waiting?
I know -- I know.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Bobo, no, I --
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
You're calling the shots.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You ever hear about the oranges?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Permanent damage.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
But they must be! They cut glass!
So I heard.
Sounds like a good Idea.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
They knocked out my tooth!
Don't mention it.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
I can't. I just left home.
Look at me.
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Big spender.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Nobody does that single-o.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You -- I don't know.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
You were gone for a while.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Yes, I know, I know.
That's that, then.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
I think someone broke into my house.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
You sure?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Now you're joking, right?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I can see that.  Why?
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Keri, you all right?
Fuckin' A.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You're so easy...
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Mom -- Who is this?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Aren't you gonna answer that?
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Halloween.
Where are you going?
Where's the baby?!
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
You've created a monster.
Stay away, Sam.
Yes?
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
A bitch.
We've never met.
No.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
Can I have the Cadillac?
You ever own a motorcycle?
Could have happened to anybody.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I dunno.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Me?
Okay.  Okay.
Everybody thinks that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
If what?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Our pleasure.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!
As a matter of fact--
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
It makes life spicy.
Mhravitch.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
A hundred dollars!
Can I get dressed first?
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
That's a rifle you have?
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Some kind of animal?
How do you do?
Like hugging a lamp post.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
We thought a doctor might help.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
You're wrong.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Yes.
Did you like it, dear?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Almost a Christmas scene.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Help your mother find the bullet.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
He's dead, you know.
She's fine.  Please--
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
None.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
You've been bitten by bats?
I was going to ask.
Correct.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
I'm high as a kite.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
My violin is avenged!
You're too modest.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
For what?
Who's dead?
I'm only ten years old.
Yes.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Kid--kid--
Thank God!
I'll kill myself.
He's alive!
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I don't get it.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
It's fine!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
Please--
Something happens to my confidence.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Yeah.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
This is very good for us.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
It's a jungle out there.
Get out of here.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
But is she, has...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
No, I don't.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
What's that shade of blue called?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Yeah.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Are you a private detective?
Up front?
Huh?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
At least I'm a growing person.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
It's not quite the same thing.
Granville?
Well, what do they know?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
And better?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
What's it called?
What is it, Jake?
What happened?
Is Marsha there?
How did you find me?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Yeah.
No.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
But I...
That's all right.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What does that do?
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
None of that, lady.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Do you sing and dance?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
Eh, fine.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
That's a nice teapot.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Is he all right?
We'll come back in the morning.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
But I don't play anything.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Well, why don't you?
Where's that?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Yes. They're old friends.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
It's all right. It's organic.
"And this too shall pass away."
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Do you play?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
No.
Harold?
Huh?
Why?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
Yes.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Harold!
Harold!
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Frank.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Kyle, you don't have...
Wait!
I... remember.
Who?
I need to touch it to "see"...
See? I don't like that --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Me?? C'mon --
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
What was that??
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Hi.
Doesn't sounds like him.
What about you?
But it's not true, is it?
That you feel that way about me.
Pardon?
Christ!
What's the problem?
You fucking ass-holes.
We want the man who did this --
Poor baby.
But you said --
I'm very happy.
Hell...
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
She'll tell them everything...
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty? It's very late.
What's the problem?
All right.
No argument.
He's here?
Julia?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
Oh baby.
What's wrong with you?
What are you drinking?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
You know it's not often I... you know...
You wouldn't believe me.
No Dad.
Well I want you to see the house.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Kirsty.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Yeah.
Really?
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Oh!
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Can I lend you a hand?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Why would they care?
How do you know about that?
Suck my ass.
My band.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
We're getting that anyway.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Rob.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
It's Vince and Justin.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Hi.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Did you say something?
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Never?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
So, how are you?
I told you I slept with him.
It's me.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I'm sure.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Are you alright?
What do you mean?
You know, with Ray...
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
How?  How were we the same people?
Harder.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Barry said its done.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Rob here.
Hi, Marie.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Are you okay?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Yeah.
That way.  You?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Sixty.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
It's my birthday.
I don't follow you.
The boy _died_?
Do you play?
It's not mine.
Byzantine?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Jesus Christ.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
No one knows you're here?
You're a fool.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
Maybe it would do us both good.
It's beautiful.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
You are a very perceptive young woman.
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
What is it?
I'm calling an attorney.
Spare me the details.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
-Et lux perpetua-
Your marks would suggest great injury.
Does it change with me in the room?
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
Why?
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Oh please.  Another one.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
No doubt.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
And the Bulgarian?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How did you find me?
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Do you?
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Morning Mr. North
What's the idea of locking this?
Seventy-five.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
But --
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Where'd she go?
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Ts! Ts! Ts!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Get out!
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
Hello, Hildy!
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
What?!!
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
I know, Walter, but I --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
What's the matter?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
I get it!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Is he coming back here?
What did you do with her?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
No, you don't! Walter!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
What's the matter with my brains?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
We know what you're up to.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
What went off?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Fred!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
I did.  Hold the wire.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
And so do I!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I won't.
What did you do with her?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
You know it is!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Pinkus.
Is it hard?
There she is!
The door was locked.
That was a googly!
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Bloody.
You're the biggest fibber.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
You need trees for an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
It looks....foreign.
What are you going to be then?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Father, that's enough now
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I agree.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Yeah, no shit.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
How much further?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Almost there.
Come on, get with the facts.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Oh, yeah.
Sleeping.
Tell me about it.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
French?
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Is everything fine?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
No!
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
No.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Shut up and tell me.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Yeah?
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
You've got to respect that.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Paper or cloth?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
I don't know. Something.
Come on.
I think he's feral.
What?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
All right.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
I'm just preoccupied.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Really?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I think he's ready.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Should I come with?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
That's right, Miss Packard.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You bastard.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Hey, mister.
Thought you only drank milk.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
For who?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Thinking about what?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Here, I got it.
Well, we won't.
How're the hands?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Well, here it's half.
Fifty per cent?
Whaddya mean?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
A son.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Findley.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Okay, friend. You're on.
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I drink.
No.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
I've got something in my bag.
No, why should I? It's yours.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
You going out?
What are you writing?
What's this supposed to mean?
What happened?
You wanna drink?
No. You?
Would he know?
Well, what's so funny?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
Why?
Where do you come from?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Yes.
What choice did I have -- ?!
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
Humans.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Virginia...?
Need some gas?
... and Rigel.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
No.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Are you all right?
We're losing them.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
They don't know this.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Dad, please...
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Grey, you read me?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Damn it!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
But I gave you some this morning.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
My reputation precedes me.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Look what you did!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
An old man's dream.
DONOVAN!
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
What's that?
Mine, too.
This.
This one. I think he's in here.
You came back for the book? Why?
Found it.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, uh...
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
And the chair.
Come on, Dad. Come on!
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
What does that mean?
Dad, are we hit?!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
Dad?!
Ready?
Who are you?
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Who are you?
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Charming.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
What's that?
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Long ago -- before my father's father.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
What do you mean -- how?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Can you move your arm?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
WILLIE?!
I want to go home...
No... they won't kill me.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Try me.
Do me a favor, Al.
My place, can't you see?
I told you, my name is Al.
Yep.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You'll be alive.
With a man in my head...
Too late...They want you.
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Now what.
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Like the guys that attacked us.
What about it?
Why not?
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Holy shit!
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Now what?
Eat it.
Wait.
What happened?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Some agent you are.
Follow her.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Probably.
You sure this will work?
haka xuki.
This may hurt.
Where've you been?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
She is beautiful.
You're a lucky man.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
Doesn't matter.
Let us get to the border!
Impossible.
Me.
You've cut your hair?
How about a deal?
...Foreign service.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
It may have been affected.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Take the card.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
The fresh tuna?..
What's what?
Blake said that?
And you?
It's not apparent.
You are.
Promise you what?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Why did you leave?
You seemed interesting.
Why did they leave?
This business is over.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
Can you?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
How?
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
A drink...
Wait.
It is?
Just one. The back up.
It will.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Hi, Daddy.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Three hours.
Sure. Where?
Good.
Do you want more rice?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
No, no, we're fine...
How grave?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Okay.  Lowell?
You ready...?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Right now?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What's wrong?
Is it too late?
Oh, my God.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Seven dwarfs?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
What did you get us?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I heard.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Yeah, great.
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Where are you, anyway?
Right.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
Poor communication skills.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
He --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
What part?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
That's his lawyer.
Grounds?
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
He's the wrong man.
My God.
What do you mean, was.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
No.
Gotcha.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Marylin? When did I say...?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
You do?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Hello Marylin.
Comfy!
Those are gifts.
You have to leave the house immediately!
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Income tax evasion?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Who's that?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Lilly's up.
Every week --
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
What?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Did Marylin end up with money?
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I am very sorry.
What do you think?
Berry spoons.
What...?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Who's "Patty."
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
How is she?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
You're a peculiar chap.
That's an evasion.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I might.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Oh, come now—
Ridiculous!
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Why should she? After all—
What happened?
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
What do you think you're doing!
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Are you talking to me?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I don't want it reported!
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
You must have me confused with—
That's none of your business.
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Like what?
Where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
You always want to run everything.
I refuse to resign!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
That's silly.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
What's got into you?
was so scared—that it scared—
What are you thinking about?
You think it's simple, huh?
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
You might give me a little credit.
Come on—get in.
Me?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
You bet we did.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Husband?
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
I've been thinking about you.
Yes?
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
Yeah? Where?
Yeah.
Joe, listen—
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
If it's on the level.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I am, Joe.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
What?
Not a minute!
Wife?
Thanks. 
What's on your mind?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Street cats?
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
Keep saying what?
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
What do you mean?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
And then Sunday?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Who was paying you, Dave?
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Please answer the question.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Honey, you all right? 
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Did they live?
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
How many men?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Yes.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
His name?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
How many men are working with you on this?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
Not a problem.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
But then you told her you were home.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Three years.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
A bit.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Why were you with him?
How'd you know where he was?
We are. Don't worry about it.
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
Take your time.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
Is it dark?
What have they told you?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
He's the one who wants you.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Uh-huh.
Are you?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
You talk them into it?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
What do you do when he comes home?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Ray wants him.
Why?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
We're partners.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
He say is a surprise.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
If it'll make you happy.
What about me?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
You think I'm kidding?
Hi, Melanie.
Do you got something for me?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Got some o.j.?
And what was your answer?
Beaumont Livingston.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
How the fuck they know that?
Who?
If you want.
But you don't?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Man, I don't like that part.
Designer clothes.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Susanville.
How long?
What for?
Yeah.
Where were you?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Is it dead?
No.
Please.
We're leaving now!
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
What did he do?
What's your relationship?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
What does that mean?
Uh-huh.
In the chest and stomach.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
That's right.
What?
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You don't say.
Haven't a clue.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
House or apartment?
I can see that. Why?
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
What?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
I thought you might be asleep.
That's all?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
We're back.
No problem.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Daddy!
They're not interested, Jake.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
I'm hanging up.
Daddy, what was that noise?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
Don't go.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You need ... a doctor.
How long had that been going on?
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
I didn't want to wake you.
What's in here?
What?
Wait. Don't.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I'm going home.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
What does it say?
How high is that?
What the hell are you doin'?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Am I home?
I know.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Oh?  Where you going?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I don't know.
I can't move.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Dream on!
I'm sorry.
I need to see you, Jake.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Why not?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
The army?
Can I help you?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Yes it does.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
What's that?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
It bought us some time.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
I'm with you kid.
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Pull me in!
Rizzo, he's out there.
Old woman?
You lost the charge?
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What?
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
What?!!
I gotta go back.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
More soldiers?
Guys, please come with me!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
You got it?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Where...?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Have you ever had one do this?
He's comin' up -- !
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Be careful.
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Michael! Come inside!
Now tell me something I don't know.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
Maybe we can save August...
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
What's that?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
You picked her up on the ferry.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
You love sharks?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
What can that gun of yours do?
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Yeah. That was me.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Wizard!
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
What? I'm not made of stone.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
You don't know anything about me!
I'm a junior.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
You know... it's parts...
Hey, I like this.
You don't have to do that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
You should try Adderall.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
You're pregnant?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Hi Dad.
You mean like couples?
I sort of already have.
What?!
Or...
I am a suicide risk.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
There are ads? For parents?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
No way! She's pretty.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Juno, what's the matter?
What?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
What would be a good time for you?
We're actually, finally doing this?
Hi, I'm Adele.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
You dropped this.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
What the hell is this stuff?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Henry Lucas.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
...I do.
Carrie.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
Could be.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Shit.
She can fuck?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
What do you want?
Yep.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Nothen' B.
You sure?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Yeah?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Who are they?
What is it?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Why is that?
What?
What?
No.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
The pain. The fucking pain!
I know.
Did you bleed?
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Whah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Making love is like.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Holy shit. That's all true?
Not too late.
Where does everyone sleep?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Yeah.
To come?
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
You're a lying bastard!
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
And -- what path is that?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Very good.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
What's this?
No problem.  We're in.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
He was watching you.
Is your dad here?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Same as the others?
Yeah.
Well?
I'm busy right now.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Did you send the car?
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
What are you looking for?
They couldn't break the riddle.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I think it's interesting.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Alright.  What about me?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
I got lucky.
It's over now.
I'm sure you are.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Lyssa ...
Will your power outward.
Lyssa ...
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
The new Queen lives.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
Never.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
How did you know?
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Yes.
You will not, then?
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Can't I come, too?
A venison pie as big as a house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
I don't think it's working.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
And do you think I live on air?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
What news from our friends?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
I knew.
You were attacked in the forest?
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
You know the voice.
She has the power of vision.
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
It is no trickery.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
OK, I'm fine.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Wow! It's brilliant!
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
May I go to the cinema?
No.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
I don't know... Five minutes.
...I got lost, Mister.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Can I sit on the stairways now?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
No it's not.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
Pardon?
Yes -- you are.
Okay.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
That's okay -- really it is.
To where?
Pacifica, California.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flags man.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
That's me.
You're amazing.
It has to be a full character's name.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
You're in pain.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
This isn't right.
No alcohol?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Are you working?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Are you serious.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Me neither.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
I know that...
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
What was that all about?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
Where have you been?
A full night on the street and this is all?
But it's a top three school --
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I'll take that as a no.
Get up.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
That's not what's important.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
No. I was in the shower.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Dewey Newcomb?
Did you get it?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
What?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I got bangs!
Neither.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
In court. On opposing sides.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Elle?
You go?  Not watch fun?
We come watch... we come watch...
What?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
But I'm hideous!
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Damn you!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
Enough!
What!
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
There must be an answer somewhere.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
What is it?
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Beware.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Good.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
What magic have we on our side?
One more turn...
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Will you explain what's going on?
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
I'll try.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Liar!
A gentleman would offer water.
Oh, dear.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Pinching?  Where?
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
No!
This is sad news, be it true.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
What do we do now?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
How came you by this blade?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
Mom said I should.
I put him to work.
You'd better call and cancel.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
What's today?
Can you keep Sam straight?
My mother would die.
It's not what I was expecting.
He jumped into the ocean.
I can't even take a shower here.
Yeah.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
How's your wife?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I've been here twenty years.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
For everything.
I've got one favor to ask.
I didn't recognize you!
He escaped.  He's going back in.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I'll hate you forever.
I warned you yesterday.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
The gloves on the table are for you.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know parts of who you are.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I loved him too much.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Left you this place.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
I was parked in day parking.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
It makes me sad.
What?
I used to live here.
What is it?
Do you need help?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You bit my finger.
No.  Mostly me.
I could die.
Does Alyssa know?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
This is what he wants.
All day again?
Is Mae Rose okay?
He's a big one.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
But you can't.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
She got married last month.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Comfortable?
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
That's because I've never been here before.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
You went to Monroe?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
You need collateral.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
So you made a generous contribution.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
What does that mean?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
What'd you say?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Him?
Crawfords.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
I said you're soft.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
All in, boss!
What are you doing here, mama?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Is everyone here?
I prefer bourbon.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
ADRIAN!
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
She goes to Parson's, right?
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Definitely.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
There's our man.
You sure you're down with this?
Schnapps...
Which way did he go?
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Hello.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
We're going to Jersey?
Hey...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
What other food?
Your own work?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
It has nothing to do with you.
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
I'm afraid to tell you.
You could have called me yourself.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I let him go... believe me.
Are you here to help me?
That's tomorrow.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Uh-uh.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
How do we know this is the right way?
What's that?
You know, Jessica.
Of course.
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Is it inside the city?
We'll have to bury him.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Are you ready to put him in?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Stay? They lived together all their years?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
I'm, okay... You okay?
What do you mean by that?
Why not?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
You recognize that guy?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Hello.
I can't see you tonight.
Sure.
Pete?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Pornos.
So, should I call Andy?
Set.
Dick Laurent?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Have you made any charges against him?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Who is it?
What about yesterday?
Do you remember?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
What's your axe?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Yeah?
We will.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
They're gonna cook him.
You like pornos?
Suit yourself, champ.
What?
What are you guys doin'?
You want some company?
Sheila...
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Well, what do you know about that!
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I beg your pardon.
I see.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Come on, Lovey.
It's unbelievable.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
No.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
And the wine - excellent.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Goodness, no!
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Suppose she should leave it?
What do you want?
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
What is it, my son?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
What is it? Has he fainted?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
George, come back!
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
You can't take her away from here!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
Yes, everything!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What was that?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
In for what?
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I wonder.
Ouch!
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
EXCUSE ME–
The hell happened?
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
They don't?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
I wasn't scared...
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Sir, you can't just--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
It's a bug.
So what's the problem?
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
What?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
What is it?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
What are you doing?
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
No.
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Did he say where?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Actually, I don't know...
Wally!
They're inside.
He'll turn around.
I have to go back.
Then who was he?
You made those tapes...
You set your patients on fire!
Victim's a white female.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
You're kidding, that's today?
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
The mall?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Yes.
But you call this room the "temple".
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Are these all of her previsions?
I need help with her.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
They don't belong to anybody.
Oh, Sean --
I was looking for you...
Who are you?
But you have to.  They said you would.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
You're talking about the precogs...
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
What safe place is that?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
What?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Can't they shut that off?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
That was our apartment.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
You know I need to use you.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
What are you talking about?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
We have snifters
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Is it a good room?
Not on me, sir.
What if I gave you forty?
Women?
So, wait, you're from where?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Is he cute?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I feel weird asking him.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
I want you to quit.
With what?
How could you let her see this?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
You driving her?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
How bad is it?
What's that?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
You like the ponies?
Pshhh...
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Yes.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
We get it. We're sorry.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Where's the drop?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Spa?
Yeah?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. I know the number.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Is that the woman from..?
What's the movie?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Oh really. Why's that?
Yeah.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
We're not getting whacked.
The penguin house.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Kinda. Yeah.
You want your surprise?
What?
S'up.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
I'm half Irish.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Good morning.
No. What is it?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Can I borrow a piece of --
What?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Dip?
What they call you?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Yes, sir.
How's it feel?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
Take it easy, baby.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
I sure met some.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
What can I do for you?
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I see your point.
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
It won't be easy.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
If you want to tell me.
Sure, man.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
I know where you're going.
Get out.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
That's a fine chick.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
The hell you are.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
That's right.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
So where do we begin?
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Where do I find him?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[And?]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
I'm here.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Nothing wrong.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It's better to be free, right?
You got that right.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Sorry.
Planned what?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Where are you?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
For a year?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For an American she understands this country very well.
You should be sleeping, baby.
Bye, Mom.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
I think it's nice he's American.
Creasy.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I told you she wasn't attractive...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Are you kidding?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
We just talked.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Ah?
Your son Marty?
Yeah.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Yes, I know.
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
You got an elevator in this house?
We just live one flight up.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
That's the one.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
Don't worry about it.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Put on your blue suit...
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
I said, is she Italian girl?
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
That's all right, that's all right...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
What are you going to do with him?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore –  House. You in the market Duke?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Never heard of him.
When?
Gimme three.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I think I heard about that.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Black capsule.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
I don't feel anything.
That's right. We work well together.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
How did you get called that?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
You're leaving tomorrow?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Second pint.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's wrong with him?
There's only one worth noticing.
No, never in the slightest.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Good morning, Colonel.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Nice.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Huh?
Against what?
No.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
About me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Did you write this?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
What's that?
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
John Doe.
Who, for instance?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh—
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
How could he be a fake? 
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Hello, Mr. Connell.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I don't get it.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
How?
What's your name?
That's got nothing to do with it!
It's for Ann . . .
Oh!
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
They're not usually graduate students.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
That's right.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Only at the very end.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
Explain how that works.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Do you really?
You think you can learn, McCall?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
I'm not good at lying.
You tell me.
To save lives.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
We won!
And what if you can't live with it?
So what do you want to do?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Greg.
Please. I'm begging you.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
You think I didn't need you?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Mmm, needs a little something.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Roper.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Are these yours?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
This is how you pick up women --
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Do you believe in miracles?
No.
You are not a God.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.

With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.

Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
Try harder.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
You've got the keys, send someone in --
One condition.
A hotel?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
I've got to get back.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
And it meant something.
Sorry?!
Why not?

The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
We could lose the deal!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
He was around...
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
You ain't even a man yet.
Something came up.
Same here.
It's a mask.
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Meyer just finished the books.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
I'm glad ya come.
This business is about taking risks.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
And what do you want out of this?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
What's the matter?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Bitchin' good cake.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I don't think so.
What's the matter?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Stu...LOOK!
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Uh-huh?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Behind the books.
Mother, I ...
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
What does he do?
Where's the Majority Leader?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
What?
Okay--I mean--
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
He's a house-afire!
What!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Aw--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
I did. What about it?
Jeff for Senator.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Hello, Jefferson.
Fine--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Tonight.
Good. Where are we?
Calendar?
We're over in the House.
Pardon?
Yes, yes--
No.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
I don't see where we are *with* it.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Hello.
What are you going to do?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Yes--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
You won't stand for it?
It's crucifying him--!
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Order!
Good morning.
Who's that?
I haven't.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
But they did take place?
And you saw them happen?
You are , aren't you?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Now, what do you see?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Had the boys follow us.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Yes, but you said—
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Nuisance value?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
He's what?
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Wants to know who the heir is.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
All set.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Why, no.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Me?!
Uh-huh.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
No, I mean - about my client.
A what?
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Binge?
Farmer?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Uh-huh. What are they?
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Why's that?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
It's a thought I had.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Doc...
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Okay.
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
We're going for a walk.
Wow. You're something.
When did you start to feel this way?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Mom's such a cutie.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
No.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
You're upset.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
Hello?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Oh.
Where was this?
Really?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Uh-huh.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
And the drugs?
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
I'm here for you, Doc.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
That was a terrible thing.
None of the above, thank you.
Why do you like to fight so much?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Immune from what?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What just happened?
Intestines.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
And what is he in prison for?
Fifty percent.
Yes.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
I found it, Evy! I found it
She's my sister, actually.
That looked rather painful.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Um-hmm.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Eat your mustard.
Yes!
Yes!
Snap out of it!
Should I kill them?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Really?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
It's me.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
What are you talking about?
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
So where's the art?
You guys going to a costume party?
Not yet.
Wow.
So what can I get you?
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
But... the silverware?
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
And there's the Sphinx.
Proceed.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
There are none here.
Where are they?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
And where is the army?
I don't know, sire.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
No, they're living in Nice now.
When you eat him, may I have some?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
What's your name?
Lisette.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
Are you trying to insult me?
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Do you expect me to believe that?
One had better legs.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Open the door.  It's me.
Five minutes.
But you will not... be safe...
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
What was there to tell?
I know.
Can you give me a drink, please?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Does she deserve anything better?
Has Alexander agreed to this?
That is a matter of opinion.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Come in.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Anything you need.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
I know you smoke weed, right?
I don't know!
Who are you?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
That's the sister.
How can they do this?
You see that?
You make it sound so easy.
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Why didn't she put'em out?
You alright?
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What it say?
Today ain't my day.
Where's Craig?
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What the fuck you looking at?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Get on.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Don't remind me.
You just come in on Amtrack?
And your husband works for somebody else.
I would also like to apologize.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
What would you do in my place?
Tell me why I miss him.
I killed you.
Keep your voice down.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
I think you better put that away.
No way.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Everybody does?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
I've done much better ones than this.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Put her on.
What do you figure he done with it?
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Who?
Amen! Amen!
How?
I tried to save her.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
She's gone to Moundsville.
I'll see to Pearl.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
I was praying.
Get up, Willa.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What do you want?
Them kids!
Pearl and John!
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
Worked like a charm.
You okay?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
No.
You believe in anything?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
What!?
Decide to take a day off after all?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
What's the Coroner got to say?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Nice to have a fire.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Good evening, Anna.
Aren't you late?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
You should be more careful, Anna.
Tell me... what else did you have?
And there?
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
What is it?
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Monsieur.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Good morning, Your Highness.
Eight forty-two, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
We can wait.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
A day.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
...and Kopalski.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
What can I do about it?
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Gladly.
What?
No.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
The bayonet? Did you really?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Room service speaking.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
What?
Just smile.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Yes.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
Thursday.
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
Much happier.
Radio! What is radio?
Is this the wish of the masses?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Yes.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Hello, Leon darling!
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Good morning.
That's all right... I grow on people.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
This will do. 
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
It's just a place for workmen.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
We'll see about that ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
May I say something, Mr. President?
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Who?
He's completely lost touch with reality.
So?
Sir, the deadline is today.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
Silence!
"Security" is not strong enough.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Just do what I say, Bob.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What ... ?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Ummm...
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
How the fuck did you know?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
I beg your pardon --
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
... as the old alliances crumble.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Syracuse.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
No, sir ...
I know ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
You.  What' you're doing --
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Some say you are, Rocky.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
Most don't.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
Yes.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Hard to believe.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Would you tell me if you had?
Yes ma'am?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
It could be.
Believe you're right.
...Now that's aggravating.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
Yessir.
Yes Sheriff.
I never do.
You gave your word?
It's full a money.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
So... for how long do we have to...
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
Why would I let you do that?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's that.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Airport.
...I know where you are.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Will there be anything else?
Now. We close now.
You married into it.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Somethin' like that.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
What do you want to know?
That's me.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Not any way.
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Yes sir. Two tours.
What outfit.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Sheriff, I don't...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Oww, the arm, the arm!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Great. Good. Content...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I am?
...I don't think I know that hospital.
What?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
I beg your pardon?
You knew Del?!
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
What?
I got you, Del...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I came for love...
Uh-huh.
What're you doing here, Roy?
Los Angeles, California.
Did you love it?
She called you 'George,' George.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
Guess who I saw today.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
What are those for?
Does he know you think he's real?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Of what?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
What?
How'd they describe her?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
I'm not telling.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Yeah?
You can't do this -
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Not out the other side his face, though.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Daddy!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Who gave you this idea?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
Is your brother a flyer?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Great.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
Seriously.
Really?
You got a girl?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I'll get it if you want.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
How do you figure that's your bunk?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
You okay?
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
No problem.
The fuck did you do that for?!
One.  Squeeze.
Th --
You got an idea?
She's gonna handle it.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
'Bout four o'clock.
That door is a safely hazard.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
What if they get in here?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Chills?
Morse code?
I'm sorry.
Why?
What?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Well... is it loaded?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
What are you crazy?
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
I don't think that will be any problem...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You call that a compliment?
I expect to try.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You got me beat on both accounts.
You don't know him very well, do you?
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Oh?
That one is a bit more difficult.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
If I fail, you fail.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
And the Governor?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Oh?
These four wagons must be his.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
What?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Go on.
Please.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Not held, just slowed down.
Goodbye, Francis.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
What's up, sugar?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
What?
It's Church.
No need to apologize.
I'm not climbing that.
It's funny, all right.
Wouldn't wash?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
I just said--
Elizabeth goes free!
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
There's ... another exit?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
Thank you, sir.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
I know the code.
Come on!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
A fool's errand.
What?  He never told me that.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
We had time to get to know each other.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Move!
Somewhat.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I'd die for her.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
... no.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Speak.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
No, thank you.
Pollution?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
Like rotting meat.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
A man?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
You're insane.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
That was an egg?
Blame the victim.
How far can you stretch?
You made this out of my hair?
You're not going after Argon!
God, what a fight that was.
That's impossible.
Vermin...
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Certainly. Right over there.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Are you crazy?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Stewart!
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
What is this person doing here?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Yeah?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
I'm not quitting!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes.
Yes.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You what?
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Right.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
A statement? Good.
Hello, Smith.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
I don't eat waffles.
Sure.
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Stop calling me Mother!
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
Did you call, sir?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
That's puttering, sir.
Yes sir.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
You want to get out of here?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It's better, Mary Sue.
What's the matter?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Why am I out of order?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
What do you mean!?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
The other one?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Lemme see that.
What did you do?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
What?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
... Yeah.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Mmmmgh.
So what's it like?
What?
How?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
You're gonna forget about me.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
McIntire's.
How much does it cost?
Why would I do that?
Re-runs?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Well don't you?
Really?
Hi.
Dream come true, hunh?
Hello.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yeah I can't.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
It's fine, but --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
No.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
No.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Hello?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
We got disconnected before....
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I need help.
You lied to me?
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Hi.
Hi.
I saw a picture of you.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
You like her?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
....yeah....
Is everything ok?
...yes I did...?
...yeah...
If you come to Hawaii --
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Did you do it?
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
I know.
Can I ask how much is this?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
It's ok, take your time.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
How many sisters do you have?
What's up?
Yeah.
Fine, thank you.
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
Hi, Lance.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Yeah.
Wait a minute --
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Well....what do you want, then?
I'm serious.
I know.
It's ok. That's alright.
You ready?
So...did my brother call you?
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Madeleine --
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
They can't be serious.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
His rug.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
A man after my own heart...
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
It's a formality; truly.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
I'll do everything in my power --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
And my own.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
They've taken your clothes?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
The actor
You know that can't happen.
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
It's not really--
I will not defend my life to you--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
There's a different between want and
I will not have this in my home.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
But with compassion and insight--
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Oh for Christ's sake-
Yes.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
I don't give a shit about-
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Oh God.
You're lying to me.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Please don't ask me to do this.
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You know?
Sure. What is it?
Yeah --
Go 'head.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
But you said "you."
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
What?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Jake...
Huh?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Where you been all day?
What're you talking about?
I'm leaving you Jake.
Open the door, Vickie.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Thanks.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
A detective's nightmare.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
For getting rid of that cast.
Read some good books.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Hello.
Gunnison?
It's me.
I predicted it.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
I knew it!
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
People have different emotional levels that --
And some man will lose his.
He and his wife splitting up?
Isn't he a salesman?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
Got a shovel?
How's your leg?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Make the one you want.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Lisa, please!
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Wasn't that close?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Chelsea 2-5598.
Steady Marlon!
Nobody chickened.
You know something?
Hi.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
How'd he get in?
You see any cops?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Yeah!
You awake?
Yes.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
I don't think so--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Are you going down there?
See?  It stopped.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
What?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Get lost.
I don't know why--!
He called me chicken.
What a zoo!
If he could--
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Plato!
Where what was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Won't mother be proud.
The kids take me.
Neither can I.
Where you going?
You can trust me, Judy.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Hi.
You don't need to do that.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
No.  Why?
Why?
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
One more. Smile. One more.
No, c'mon --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Where the hell are you going?
You need a COAT!
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Get the hell off of me!
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Gabriel!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
He working for them on this one?
They'll have guns.
Nick, what are you talking about?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
But I never said Rudy.
You what...
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Nnn... nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
What's the code?
No.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No, you're not.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Ash?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
What... Powwow...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
We're aware of your position.
You want that for here or to go?
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Hell you haven't.
What?
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Just a roach, Zook.
NO!!!
She set them up. All of them.
And you set me up.
There is no other table --
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Sure.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Give me this fucking thing.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
How many employees?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
What happened?
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Gun shot.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
How can you be so sure?
No shit?
We can't take him to a hospital.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Of course.
Maybe he did.
Who shot who?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Yeah.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
The who?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
All right -- it's said!
All my clothes --
It's going to Sonora.
So did I. They were in it.
I can't --
I don't want to run short.
Where'd they go?
That's right, Steve.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Yeah, it does.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
It isn't that --
Yes, people make me restless.
What's the use.
We might as well start a fire.
Where is he?
Because there's a man I want to see.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Maybe I could start you out.
You're so nice.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
She was only teasin'.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Really? That's amazing.
Oh my God! We're dead!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
You sure?
He's right. I should go first.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
There's something I really want to share with you.
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
It was you...
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Gear. You know, clothing.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Let me help you.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
She's right. We should stick together.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
It's okay. I understand.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Is MOM... in there?
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Why?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
I love that you're my wife.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
"P" as in...
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
MOTHERFUCKER!!
So you do drink?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
You got your wish.
Beverly, are you alright?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You can't tell.
You scared?
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Why, Mary --
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
But I like teaching school.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Good.
But you do believe me?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
You'll be all right?
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
Is it about Jacqueline?
I'm very, very serious.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I'll be out in a minute.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I don't know.
Does it bother you?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
My therapist said that --
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
You just ask them questions?
She said it on her tape.
Don't you want to make one?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What will you do when the money runs out?
It won't. Are you ready?
Tell me your name.
Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes.
No.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
So you do fantasize?
Can't.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Subtlety?
You're really never going to make love again?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
But I don't understand --
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Who'd you have lunch with?
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I want out of this marriage.
Why?
I have thought about it, yes.
What do you mean?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
What brought this on?
Yes.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
What!?
But why did you want to?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
What is it?
There's a phone here.
You want me to leave?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Nothing.
Would anybody else see the tape?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
He said that my hand felt good.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Hello.
John Millaney.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Graham.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Everybody has a past.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Answer him, goddammit!!
He said immediately.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
No, nothing.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Well? Supper at my place?
Where is he now? Do you know?
You say something?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
We live in 703.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I've caught it once or twice.
When do I get to see Brad?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Indulge?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Could I do that later?
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
Me?
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
WHAT A JOKE...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Glass or bottle?
You okay, Miles?
Two years ago, buddy.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Oh yeah. Much better.
You still seeing that shrink?
That's what you do with every one.
It's not even a mile.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Perfect.
Have you no shame?
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
I want to go home now.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
We're on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Count me out.
Hey, there you are.
Understanding of what?
Fucker hit into us.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
I don't have to.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
What's that supposed to mean?
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
That's thoughtful.
Huh. Let me think.
We gotta go back.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Hey.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
How long have you been into wine?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Yeah? Like what?
Okay.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Ken.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
So what's happening with your book?
I am.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Sir, what are you doing?
Stephanie! Stop!
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
I think it's contaminated.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Morgan, be careful.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Yes.
What time is it?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're broadcasting...
How do they know it's over?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
We might lose the signal.
Oh.
Where are we going to sleep?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
I don't think so.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Sounds good.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Goodbye?
South of here, past Chimayo.
It's a town...
I expect.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
What about the law?
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
He is now.
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Why would they stop you?
You've got a legitimate job.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
You work here?
And I know what I'm talking about.
What makes you say that?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Okay -- for you.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Almost right.
Hair and make-up?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Better late than never.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Not if I don't let her.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Where are you?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
Of course.
... so much like her?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
It was more in passing.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
I know what you mean.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I read.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
What?!
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
She looks a lot like you.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Dark?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
You could play the lead.
What if it catches on fire?
Hi.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Wow. They called you their son.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
I forgot your name.
Dr. Crowe.
You want to ask me a question?
You said the "s" word.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
What'd you write?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
...No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
I don't know, Cole.
--What?
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
They're right here.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
They did?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
What?
Excuse me?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Superstition.
Could take a little while, though.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Aha. The Lovers.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Curt Cobain.
So... what does it do?
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
He started it.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
About what?
What's wrong?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
...no... Mac... p-please...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Grant, where'd you go?
How about Brenda?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
What's she see in that douchebag?
Rorschach.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
All the rib eyes?
Flip.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
You.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Well?...
Can I ask you something?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
And?
My very words.
He's just exhausted.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
But you'll do it?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Also boring.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Bandit?
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
You okay?
-- How we doing?
What's that, pardner?
How's the clock, Bandit II.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Now, you just find him, son.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
That's correct.
Anything on the Swede?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
You woulda?
Damn... alright then.
Really?
...About what?
That's not possible. I told you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
About what?
Do you want me to say I did it?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
-- will be handled back in --
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.
No shit.
You love her?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
What were you doin' here anyway?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What else did Padiche say?
I can trust Rheya.
You're not Gibarian...
No?  Who am I, then?
Where's his body?
That's fantastic.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Sartorius?
He'll let me in.
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
Rheya.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
Who have you been talking to?
You... she said I didn't love her.
You're the coward.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
You're lying.  I'm not human.
You should have told me.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Is that really what you want?
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Followed by non-human manifestations.
You live in Manhattan?
Would you pick one out, please?
Didn't do very well, did you?
You were reading my Renoir.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Could be, I guess.
No dog.
You don't like him, do you?
Good night, Mike.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
My ass is falling.  It is.
Why?
I think -- she's crazy.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
It's not your taste.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I'm sorry.
Let me drive...
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
At my house...!
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
I asked for the man in charge...
Let my kid go.
How are things going, pal?
How about dinner tonight?
Shooting?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
You're making my life difficult.
Just call me Spidey.
Thanks, I already ate.
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if they're not clever.
Uh is a good start.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
I'd never admit that.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
Hello, Liz.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Toxic dumps, huh.
I'm a photographer, remember?
It's fine.  Tell me what--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Need any more help?
No…
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
We made a deal with Barrack One.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
What's the match gag?
Ready?
How much more do we have to take from him?
What some brandy?
Yeah.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
You were saying --?
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Jawohl!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
It's that song, Harry!
What about Schulz?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
We did it.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You told them, Hoffy.
What are we going to do with him?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ach so!
What did you say?
December seventh, forty-one.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The what?
He is.
Target their Bridge.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, are you all right?
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
All of us.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Yes, where would you go?
Well, may we have a look around?
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
We don't have a tractor beam.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
No, no, it's not. It's better.
And what would that be, sir?
Aye.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
No, sir.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
The thought had crossed my mind.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Tractor beam, aye!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Calm yourself, Bones.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
I'll go...
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Good shooting, Scotty.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
My God...
Yes. And I know you.
Yes, yes, Spock...
Count on our help, sir.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Give me your hand and we both live.
... He spoke of your friendship.
Yes... But -- how...?
What must I do?
What I have done, I had to do.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Sir, may I suggest --
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
My Lord... what are your orders?
Sir, may I --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Shore leave, Admiral.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Wait --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Jim --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
I saw it -- !
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I'm Admiral Kirk...
It's a long story.
How soon --
I didn't expect anything.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Departing dark side, Regula.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Mr. Scott on discrete.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
That's it?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Stop engines.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Oh, joy.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
That is what I said, Doctor.
... Best shot...?
We're just -- observing.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Why's that?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
So. There we are.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
What is our target in time?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Spock...
Exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Status?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
They are my friends.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Don't you ever get tired?
Really.
No... I want to stay with you...
And our people?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
She's stabilizing.
Hello, Data...
Captain, Geordi...?
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
How many?
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You're not finished here?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
Full impulse.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Ask them.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
One. It's Ru'afo.
... Population three hundred million...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Montana.  Energize.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Dispersive armor is holding.
I am the Borg.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Captain?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
Agreed. Options?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Worf to Bridge.
Riker here.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Specifically of...?
That cunning little Vulcan...
Barely.
I was nervous -
They'll respect him now...
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Yes.
I am.
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
This is incredible -
Sorry -
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Captain, our shields -- !
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Me?
Never been this close.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
The peace conference.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
You must have faith.
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
If you are logical.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Beverly, come in.
Is he very much like you were?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Now, you make a toast.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
How long until we reach the fleet?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
I'm going to miss you.
Do you have life support?
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?
Sir, we're being hailed.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Understood.
Not with the Romulans.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Captain!
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Anything.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
How did you end up on Remus?
Looking up at the stars.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
Hello, Jean Luc.
What are you doing?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
No -- this is wasting time.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Benny, God, take it easy...
I don't see anything.
Sure.
I'll have to run your card off now.
Do you have children?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Clarify that.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Hello George.
Shermin...
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Mrs. Haydn...
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Please...
Gear shift.
What?
No gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Gas.
I...
I want to try it.
When do you have to be here?
No.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
The car will stop?
Goodbye.
What happened?
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Yes.
Yes.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I will go. But not you.
I must meet my ship.
Good morning.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I understand.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
This is yours...
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Is it for real?
Bullshit!
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Where are you going?
I told you...
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Cut it out, Tran.
Tonight.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Thanks, Max.
But this is a bad one.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
What?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I always do.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
How's Zander?
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You sure?
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I'm not going.
I guess.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
See you downtown.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Was this him?
Testa?
No.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
You tell me.
Hi there.
What?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
My God.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
He was sitting here?
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I'm hesitant to...
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
I was looking for a pattern.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Dick Low's a killer too.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
You are so fucked up.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
You got a point there.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
What did you tell him?
The tattoo?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
It's quite advanced.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Maybe you should back off.
Yeah.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
No.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Thanks.
...maybe...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Tell me about it...
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Charles! What's up, man?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
He's so sweet. He really said that?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
On the table.
You have to lay it on the table.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Listen. I had a great time.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Why didn't you call?
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
What'd you get?
Oh.  Where is this place?
Sounds more like Aids...
Ah, there's the rub...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
What's the point?
Make someone bleed.
Who threw this party, anyway?
Not well.
She was cute.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
VEGAS.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
You think they're watching?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Mikey's the big winner.
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Sorry about interrupting...
She thought you were money.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
No.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
We got the digits, baby.
How long do I wait to call?
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
It's on.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
It's on...
I ask for Justice.
An eye for an eye!
Yeah.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Outside.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
What percentages for my family?
Is it necessary?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Don Tommassino.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Who are those girls?
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'm German-Irish.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
How will they come at you?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Sure.
Michael?
Huh?
Will you?
Tell me!
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
What?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
How can you be sure?
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
What is it?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
You straightened my brother out?
How do you do.
Is that good?
Uncanny!
It's vile.
Okay, darling.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
You're breaking my ribs!
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
What does he say?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
How?
Marge-maintenance.
You should watch that!
Hardly.
Mr Greenleaf.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Dickie!
I'll go and see what's the matter.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Ha. Did he say why?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Hello Marge!
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
What?
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
This is spectacular.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Which is?
Emily.  Just kidding.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
And tomorrow?
Ten thirty?
We'll be there.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
I'm fine.
Hello. What are you up to?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
November, I thought.
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
You have, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
How much for everything.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
What kind of people?
Really?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?
You must be rich.
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Damn.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
This is sort of high class...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
You forgot "sexy".
Try holding the match like this.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
For a fee.
Where.
Do they drug you?
I can leave anytime I want.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Yes I am.
No Sir.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Oh?
Sure.
I'm no cop.
Real down.
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Neither do I, I guess.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Well yes I suppose ...
Motor oil?
Mason.  Mason?
Surprise, surprise.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Do you... remember me?
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
I'm sorry.
We were in love... weren't we?
Were we going to get married?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Start with what you knew then.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Ernie.
The film broke...
Anybody take it?
Zackly.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Call me... Ishmael?
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Cigarette?
Luke didn't smoke.
Not any more.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
The customers?  I don't know...
That you got let go.
Ancestors?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
I already have.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
San Francisco.
I suspected as much.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Is anyone there?
Look.
Oh, I suppose so.
Don't you like us?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
No, it's Lois!
I see. How do I get down there?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yes.
Are you sure?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
A what?
Tell him about the party.
I don't know.
Then he saw.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Monday?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Some of them are.
I didn't break that window!
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Can't see a thing.
I'm sure.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
He was watching a ball game on television.
Will I be seeing you again?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
What'll it say?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Hear!
Mmm?
Melanie, Melanie...
I think it's safe to get out now.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
There we are!
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
But this woman -- and her son --
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Yes, I suppose so.
We can't be sure of that.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
She's unconscious.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You've no thought of going there?
No.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Afraid of what?
Toddy hates me.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Any attacks of pain since?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
What did they give you?
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Someone else did it.
It's not. I can't take it.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
You mean Alex.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Are you ok?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
He'll be there at 8:30.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Yes.
Hi Mom!
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me what?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Hello--
I wonder if we ought to--
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Can't stand light?
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Don't!  Stop!
Leave him alone.
Look.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
I like Michael.
He looks dead.
We are...
Michael!...
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Ohmygod...
Mom!
Say hello to Thorn.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Does it burn?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Now you and David...
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Huh?
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What's the matter?
Dogs don't eat each other.
What was he doing in the rec room?
How you doin', old boy?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Cut him loose?
The dogs?
Then I'll have to kill you.
Not the only one.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Hey, Sweden!!!
What are you doing?
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Four!
Tie up Clark, too.
This storm do that?
Maybe it ain't coming.
So what do you make of it?
He's one of them.
You hear that?
I had an accident.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Where?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
This is it?
What are you?
Sir... have you a name?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
What's it all for?
This has to end.
Vox...
I won't leave you like this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I don't understand.
Created?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
A man can change his history.
I don't think that's going to happen.
It's spectacular...
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
I -- what are you?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
Got here as soon as I could.
I need to... um... talk to you.
All right, what is it now?
Alex...?!
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
Yes.
Your husband is dead?
Why?
Good night, then.
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Learning was important?
Is it?
So you can use it now?
Then it's time to change that --
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Should we be...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Relax.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
And what's that?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
How'd he die?
But no one knew until after...
Do you really believe me?
How long do we have?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
Where are we going?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Then, where are you going?
Good. How's your mom?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
You were convicted of the crime.
No. I don't want it to.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
What do you mean?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
You don't understand.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Well, what time is it?
It doesn't look all that different.
I do believe you...
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Becker does? Are you sure?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Well, where are you from?
What's this?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
[Beat] Why?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
How?
On what?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
How are things goin' out there?
Alright.
Armed robber.
Oh shit.
Stop.
What for?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Not yet.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Hello...
Will you at least see how it fits?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Okay.  I will, too.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
Did you finish thinking?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
She thinks he's a pig.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
It won't work.
Now what?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
What little dogs?
Gosh.  It sure is.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Yeah, you want it?
What?
I said all that?
What do you mean?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Shit!
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
You too, sweetie, the best.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Where?!
Then let's not get caught.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Where you goin'?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
I am?
Who?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
We're in love with your roommate.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Am I?
Same here again.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Fine. Fine.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
A fucking moron.
Mary ah, forget it.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Fuck!!
Any idea where I might start looking?
No.
No.
So she's married?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
What do you mean 'why'?
Your turn?
Kim and I are close friends!
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
You what?
And you met Mary how?
Nice.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
That must make it tough.
'That right? Good for you.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
What's a mook?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Pat does projects all over the world.
You don't think they're too big?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Can I pour you one?
What...?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
The prom -- you going?
Hi, Ted.
He's dead.
You look great.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Why not?
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Yeah? What do you want?
You got what stuck?
It.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
I wasn't trying --
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Franks and beans!
Yes.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
The other thing is...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Smoke.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I want an hour with him.
Secretary of Defense...
What about you? Where are you going?
I don't like what's happening.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Bob?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Hey.
You're my hero, Carl.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Six rounds. 357.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
I did.
How'd you know?
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Tread matches. It's the car.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
What did he say?
What was he saying?
He also said "listen to the water."
I don't see the connection.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
What?
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Thank you.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
X21, give me a 20.
X21. Come back.
Ray...
What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Why not?
Where did you see that?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
There you go with those moves again.
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
How about anything, anything you want to do.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What plane.
You're horrible
Does it bother you?
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
It's just as I thought.
I want it understood.
Anything.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
That's not what I hear.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
You don't believe that.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Now?
Off me or off you?
What does it mean?
I was, later.
Well... What   is   it?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
What is?
I'm pulling up.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
280, 290, 300 knots.
The plane is fine.
But I have to!
What was that?
How was it?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
We did it!
What the hell is this?
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Figured it out yet?
Nope.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Just below ten thousand.
So have I.
You won?!!!
How do you feel?
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Why not?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
What happened to number five?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Get it, please.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
So why am I still alive?
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
What is it?
Your sexual orientation?
Brunette.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Any news of Quaid?
Where?
Oh, Rekall.
I don't know.  Maybe.
How did I get in this taxi?!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Well...What do you say?
Let me finish!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Right.  Mars.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
I don't remember you.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Now what?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
How much you think?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
So...now what?
Why?
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Like hell you are.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Civil?  I'm civil.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
What?
And I appreciate it.
Ready?
What's it doing?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Of course.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Ten years is a long time.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
That's why I hate experts.
...Jesus!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Murder witness.
I embellished.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Edward T. Dowd.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
I see: He'd walk out next month.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
You getting this?
For control of the prison drug trade?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
And why was an exception made?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Don't get funny with me again.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
An old woman and her grandson.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Is there a golf course around here?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Phillip?
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
I see. He does talk loud.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Accidental?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
I don't know what to do.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Well, why not?
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Laura?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
No, you should forget about last night.
You got it.
The pages are gone. That's real.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Why? It does.
James...
I've got to see you.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
No.
You'd think so.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Dad.
Did you get this from your lover?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
As if I didn't know.
Yes.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
What is the truth?
...yes. Get her on the phone...
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
That's not my handwriting.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
No.
I'm just an M.D.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
I was her doctor.
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Yes.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.
Yes.
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
Hi.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
What?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Overruled...
Is this a bad time.
Do you think it's my fault?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Continental Casualty...
From the magazine?
This is Miss Costello...?
Kathy Price.
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Then why don't you testify?
Yes. Yes, I have.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What the hell are you doing here?
Yes.
Yes.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
Is that it over there?
What's he like?
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
How long was I out?
They've blocked it!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
What?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Is he all right?
He was just here!
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Home.
In what, a romantic comedy?
What...happened?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Yes?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Did we lose anybody?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
We were idealists.
What are they doing?
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Can we talk?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Ya know... "It".
So... What happened?
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
That's how he died you know.
Northeast sir!
Uh, huh.
What's on your mind?
Stow away?
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
It has nothing to do with him.
Who is it Philip?
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
What's that?
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
I'm sorry...
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Y'all take American Express?
What's Cao Ben?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
This your car?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
What's that?
Have now.
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
That's right... Take one of these.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Club Zanzibar.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
So, it's back to the islands.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
In a fire, as I recall.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
You okay, honey?
That don't seem fair.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You up for that?
What'd you say to her?
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Huh?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
How'd you know my daddy?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
Let's leave here.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
How can you say that, Sailor?
Mama???
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
What do you want me to do about it?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Through the forehead?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Santos... I can't...
What?...
I didn't see nothin'...
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Your wife.
He said something about being between things.
She left me. Crabs.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
So sensitive.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
That was MacCaulay.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Excuse me?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
How long have you been having them?
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Can I ask you something about her?
I put you on the floor.
What'd you tell him?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Outside Scranton.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
So, why did you take me up there?
I never said that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
What would you call them then?
It's because you don't eat.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I thank you.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
That strikes me as odd.
Hey.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
He cribbed that from Borges.
I'm sure.
Hm.
You got me.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Who's that sitting in your car?
I know.
I told Walter.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Grady?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Who's that guy?
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
How old is Anna?
Cherry.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Aren't you glad?
When?
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Don't you have friends?
I would.
Got something to hide?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I wasn't feeling well.
I'm adjusting okay.
Have you seen Walter?
I'm twelve.
Banished... yeah.
They sound like finches.
Yes.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Can't I stay a little longer?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
You seem a little hostile today.
It's very good, indeed.
How's that?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Do you think you're crazy?
How long is this going to take?
How do you define it?
What did you think would happen?
What did you want to happen?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
No, I am not going to --
Not so fast.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
I'll buy a plant.
Doesn't it get noisy?
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
Is that all?
Look, you can go now.
Sorry.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
I've changed.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Being here, with me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
All three -- in chronological order.
It's a bad idea.
Don't do that.
What's your fucking problem?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Nice shot, Lins.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Wasn't up to me.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
I'm switching off now.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Son of a bitch!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Hippy, you pussy.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Stand by on the ROV.
4800 feet.  It's official.
Would we see the flash?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Four or five days.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
And what about you?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
And why did you drop them?
What are you saying?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Aren't you going to change?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Have you ever been in love?
But for what reason should I come there?
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
What happened?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
And what are we going to do now?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
What boat?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
I would like to ask you something.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Through someone else?
I can't say.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Why?
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm being punished.
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
Should you see a doctor?
Well, who in particular?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
He's told you?
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
The baby they made up.
From God.
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What's your real name?
I've stopped menstruating
Like what?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
How did she know that?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Not my fault.
Sometimes, yes.
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Her headaches.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Yes I am.
Of what?
Because I wasn't worthy.
It grew.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Agnes who did you see?
Who?
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
???
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
You have proof?
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Two packs a day.
Who was the father?
Obviously there was.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
Shortly after she came to us.
Not simple, no.
You hate us don't you?
I'm only interested...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Nothing.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Listen to her singing.
Would it stop you if I did?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Don't be ridiculous.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
That's a lie.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
I'm a deserter, too.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
You do - repeatedly.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Well ... come on.
I don't think that bit's right.
Are you supposed to be here?
What's that mean?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
What are you?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Books are good!
Parading's better!
Parading?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Y'what?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Let's have you.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You are.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
You're a window rattler, son.
Oh, leave off!!!
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
But...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Oh... God... am I cold...
Hell, we're equipped --
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Close enough to walk to!
I'll go first.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Yes!
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Where's it coming from?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
What do you mean?
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
<u>How</u>?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What common objects?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Oh well... you know me.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Would somebody fill me in?
What film?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Two down, four to go.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Yeah... I forgot.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
I'll get you out of there.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
What is it?
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Yeah?
What?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Still got him?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
What's the problem?
There's still time to back-out.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Do you believe him?
Phoebe.
May I come in?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Hungry?
Just like that.
It wasn't meant to be.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
You know me better than that.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
We're?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Margo.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Where?
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
I told her. I sounded off.
Take care of yourself out there...
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
You in a hurry?
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
So she seems.
For instance what?
- guilty.
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
I don't have to. I want to.
Also Addison deWitt.
Is that what you want me to be?
So am I.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You think?
Find out.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Behind in your dues? How much?
It was for my report.
If I only knew how...
Hollywood.
Karen.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Of course.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I'll never get over it.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Over my dead body...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
There are other plays...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
They're your fans, your audience-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
What about Bill?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Well...
Lloyd, what happened...?
That's on time for Margo.
It's just possible she didn't...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Now just a minute!
Well of all-
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
To you, too?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I mean really, deeply angry...
"Liebestraum."
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Miss Caswell?  What?
When's the audition?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Promise.
I said I'm a dying man!
--it was bullshit the way it was--
What's that?
Goddamnit--
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
Go on, go on--
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--shit, who do we know?--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
How high up, which Republicans?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
It's nothing personal, though. 
Morning or night?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Sure--off the record.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--you got more than one source?--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Which people?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
What do you want to know?
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
--this'll only take one second--
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--what do you think?--
We can't talk inside either?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Haldeman too?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
It is.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Anyone but Bernstein.
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
Sure.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
You're gonna shit your pants!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Hi...
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
You want onions?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
This isn't any better, Chris.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
I don't get it, that really works?
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Pontificated.
Right.  That gives us...
Did I miss anything?!
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
You can do that?
What's up, fellas?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
You did it.
Move with the music.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh...ungghhhhh!
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Ready for what?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
...Guess what?
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Salots! Shitfucker!
What?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
What about your glasses?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
This looks familiar...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Are you okay?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Holy mother of God...
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
God. I can't believe it.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
You recognize her?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
What about me?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Well?
Where is your home, Anya?
Noooo....
No! I look ridiculous!
You'll laugh.
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Poor Meetoo!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Come on up!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
I'm sorry.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
It's her.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
How is our current financial status?
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Who are you?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Tsch.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Alvy, I...
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh, no, I have a car.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
M'hm...
Neat?
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
God bless.
Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
As Balzac said...
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Let's just do it, all right?
M'hm.
It's his name.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
It was just great!
Two?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Here's a real present.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
What?
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
This is my room.
Step up here!
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Ah.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
All right-so we can afford it.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Oh yes.
Was it a contractor?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
What?
Leo?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I'm not.
To dander.  Otis.
Really.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Thanks for coming.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Can I open it?
Directing suits you.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Oh yeah...
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Go.
Hey!  Would you?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
We closed.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
There's still time to undo this.
Did you invite them?
You're out of your mind.
Kiss the back of my knees.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Two minutes.
Truce?
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
It's a novel.
What are you saying?
Don't do this!
You changed your mind.
I'll be with you.
I know.
Has she called?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Yes, she is.
Yes I did.
Don't I find what?
Not long.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Sally did all this herself?
Are you okay?
Lemon.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
How's he doing?
Ryan.
They're nothing like us.
You're not serious.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Is there space here?
I was impressed.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Will champagne help?
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Well, something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
What did I do?
You're keeping a record, are you?
I didn't know you had this.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
She's such a great photographer.
A notch above the storage room.
I trust you.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
I'm Princess Bala.
No...as a matter of fact...
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
We're going to die!
Want a list?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Who is that idiot?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Affirmative.
So...you two are in love?
Yes, what else?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Sheldrake?
Care to make a small wager?
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
Why?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I don't understand --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
What's her first name?
As soon as I can walk.
Your stomach?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
I am. Let me get the cards.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
There's a call for you --
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.
I see you bought some napkins.
What?
I guess so.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I'm fine all over.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Oh.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
This?
You know how people talk.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
To me?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
You like?  It's all yours.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
No, no -- just had a little accident.
You?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Good night?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Yes, I know.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Important?
We talked about a lot of things.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Coming?
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
All set for what?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
What are you talking about?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
It won't happen again.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Yeah --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Dreadful.
I said I like all of them.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby what?
How about a drink ?
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
Arch light.
What do you see?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
Can I go get those mangos now?
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Get in there !
What the hell is it?
When'd you do it?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
What is it?
Who knows? Right.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Ours.
No, sir.
But why ?
Well, he's killing now.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
American weapons?
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Do you know that jungle?
What's your name, sailor ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
How big it is?
I got bored in Saigon.
No. Walked.
Hairy ?
I'm Kurtz.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah, I like it...
I think think a lie stinks.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
No -- no, Captain.
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
So that's it.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
20   CONTINUED:  
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
34   CONTINUED:
39   CONTINUED:
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
How did she..?
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Let's go.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
You're hurt.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Have to get these wet things off.
You don't feel cold?
It was blown up with the plane.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Alleged killer.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
How was it talking to him?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
I've got Jews at my table.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Carol the waitress?
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
What's this?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
You take off when you have to.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Stop asking everyone.
And mean it...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Fries.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I'll take you... why not?
The two might go together.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Go ahead.
What do you want, Melvin?
What job?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Well...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Good evening.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
What is this?
Tachlinkov.
We go around once.
Okay.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Who is the mark?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Ten million --
Who is that other guy?
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Why?
Yeah.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
I killed him.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
I was just different.
But you knew what they were training you for?
The exotic women.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
My first take?
They become complicated... messy.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
No.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Do you think he's here?
Really?
But he won't shoot you right then?
Then, we wait.
Except --
I don't believe that.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
You didn't take it.
I didn't notice them.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Why?
Yes.
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
How much farther?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
What are you thinking about?
Go ahead.
How would you like the funds?
This will take some time.
What did the beer cost?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
That stinks!
He was an electrician?
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Am I late?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
You're sure?
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
No!
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
If you get out can we be together again.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Can we charge admission?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
And take Jiri with you?
Will they free me?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Am I invited?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Did you take your things over to my place?
This is your doing?
That's right.
Really!
We had a deal!
Hey Doug, where you been?
When the hell did you write that?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Come on Holly!
That's my bag.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
So, who is in the building?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Why not?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
Yeah.
Landon --
Now it's okay?
Yeah.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
I'll take a chance.
You think so.
In ten words or less?
You have to believe to have faith.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
We're doing something -- ?
I don't understand...
You planned this --
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
It was a play.
Dad --
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
No.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
I'm not tired.
I'd do that --
Thank you.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
How old are you?
Learn anything?
I'm going to be at the dance.
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
What?
Pro, the sun's out!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
The power converter...
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Well, it was there.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
There's no way of knowing.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
Obviously!  
Dick? Dick who?
No way!
What's going on?
Okay.
Does he bite?
You lost that one?
Tom...
Sure is pretty.
Nothing.
Hi.
What?
Are you sure?
Look at all this junk.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
That's Montana over there.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Just thinking.
Just gimme a chance.
New Jersey?
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Then what?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Anybody we know?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Where're you goin'?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Another 'you'?
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
...I know this must look... funny.
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
...This'll sometimes help.
...Who is this?
Ever talk to him?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
No, what did it say?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Can be. Not easy, but –
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Charlie. How are you.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
Nope.
...Got a sweetheart?
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
...I just don't know what... to do–
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Is this multiple choice?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Excellent picture.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Why did you change your name?
How long were you having sex with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
I don't smoke.
I'm tired.
Why not?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
What did you pay Nilsen?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Did you think it was so special?
Did you like her to watch?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
I'm writing a book.
I finished my book.
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Thanks.
What you doin', son?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
What's goin' down, son?
I got tired of being played with.
You don't like punk rockers?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Catherine says you don't like her.
If she's telling  you the truth.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
What was the motive?
So what do we do -- nothing?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
It was an accident.
You knew her, didn't you?
She's a suspect.
Can there be some mistake?
I don't know.
Naa..
Let's get out of here.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Annina Nosei.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
What do you mean?
I'm here.
They're just words.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Would you like to see the wine list?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Can I walk you home?
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
I thought you hated this place?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
What's that?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
Some of them.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
I need this?
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
"We"?  You and...
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Nor I, on the second.
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Son!
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Specify, please.
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
What are you talking about?
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I see you knew him.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
And?
Who's Ivy?
What?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Where is my wife?
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Our work?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
It'll never work.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Like normal folks.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
He sure did.
Find anything interesting?
Touchy, touchy.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
I need to be part of this.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
A hit.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
What did you see?
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
That's it?
Joker here. Can we talk?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Peanuts?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It's the last thing we need.
Liar.
She's ... well, she's good.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Maybe two cars.
Welsh.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Doctor Jacobson?
Yes?
Come on Sting!
What's gone?
What a dork. Huh huh.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
What's your problem Beavis?
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
That's not that much.
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh, you first.
Well where is she?!
Bunghole...
Beavis.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
Wave at the lion.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Anything happen while I was away?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>You</u> left me.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
What happened?
I guess we open it.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
We were trying to scare your mother.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
This is <u>my</u> town.
Are you available?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just get some people out of our house.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
I want to get in.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
No, dummy.  Two.
I don't know what that signal means.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
W... What is it?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Where is your mother?
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Stepmother's...
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I cannot believe this.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Oh, fine.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Chauncey...
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
No. I'm not busy.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
... Are you sure you like it?
I agree.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Yes, Ben - he is.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Yes.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Good morning, Louise.
... I see.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
1952...?
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes, I will.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
... In the garden?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Good. Anything else?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich.
I never played a jewel thief.
Morning.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
What?
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
She's very beautiful.
The ferret?
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Sure, after a fashion.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Pardon?
My name is Schwartz.
Mr. Juarez?
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Yessir.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Moving story.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
I’m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Yikes.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Sure. It'd be fun.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Let him try.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello. Wendy.
No.
The Great Mantini?
Fine. Let's drop it.
Think, Jew florist?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I'm getting divorced.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Is there dancing?
Yeah?
Can I get you a drink?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
That's the last thing they took from me.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You still know.
YOU HURT ME.
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
What you want'em for?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am..
They good whitefolks?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Morning.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
No use thinking these things now.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
All he can. All he can.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Where'd she been?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Sir, please lower your voice--
What--
Who has your undies, Walter?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
Yes, heh--
Color?
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Oh yeah?
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
You're not interested in sex?
Oh, no.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Uh-huh.
Jeffrey--
Hey man--
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
The what?
Huh?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Dude--
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Uh-huh.
No.
Is the car out front yours?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
He can't walk, Walter!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Walter Sobchak.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Dude, I'm sorry--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Ah fuck it.
Mind if I smoke a jay?
'Scuse me?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Oh, shit.
Shit, sorry man.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Walter--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Each day is a little life.
What?
It means "bloodbrother."
You came back for me.
What's your problem, Whistler?
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
What's going on?
Nomak?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Maybe I don't see it that way.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
"The Blood Tide".
You used me as bait?!
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
What do you see here?
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
Any progress?
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
But you -- died --
Please --
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
How many of you are there?
What happens then?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
But you use blood banks --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
He killed them?
How did you escape?
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
No!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
That's a joke?
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
--or someone--
I want to see the tapes.
Yeah.
You have to go.
I don't think it was them.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
What?
Yeah?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
What?
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
Cotter?
I'm not finished.
This isn't about us.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
<u>What</u>?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Just let it go, I've got you!
For a blur?
Jesus.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
What?
Spare me.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Anna--
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
--it's urgent!
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Abby. What's the matter?
...Where is everything?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
So how long have you know Meurice?
He needs a room, Dusty.
What night is it?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
Back where?
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Yeah.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
What do you think?
Ya catch any fish?
Of course.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
You said the usual--
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
Tuesday.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Yes.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Is Sandy part of this?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Where are we going, Frank?
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh he forced you, huh?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
Do you like talk like that?
No.
You don't?
Falling.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Yes.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
No thanks.
Here's to Ben.
Okay Frank.
Am I bothering you?
Terrible. boring.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
It's good to see you.
I should go with her, Sandy.
How ya doin' Dad?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
You can change it if you want to.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
What is?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Why are you speaking?
I see.  How much?
What can I do for you guys?
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
What did I tell you?
No fucking way.
Not really, no.
Because I got caught.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Derek Foreal.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Who's the cheapskate?
Un sapo?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Family.
Money.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
How are you doing, George?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
Hello.
I don't know.  My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
You mean, like a trip?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Where are you going?
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
But I have a visitor.
Okay, George.
Right on.
The strike is a success; but ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Where were we?
Are you ready, colonel?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That's what my report will read.
Increase his heart rate.
What did they argue about?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
That's ridiculous.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
That's enough.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Yes.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
We dated for about a month last year.
What happened next?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
--and that he changed his will?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Yes.
Something like that.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Is it against the law?
I'm the photographer.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yes -- she did.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
Alone?
What are you going you doing?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
No -- he's lying.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Because I'm expecting a call.
But Your Honor--
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Why did you lie to me?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's not that long.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
No treasure maps, huh?
What?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
She's changed.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
That's it.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
And how long are you here for?
No, your kids.
Why?
He's very... clean.
I feel so embarrassed.
But I... We don't even know each other.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Why did you stop?
I'm sorry. That was...
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
You must get lonely at times.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
No, I'm just saying --
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Okay. See you later.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I can't do this, honey.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
No one's asking you to!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
But now that you have it -
No. Don't do this.
'Bout 4:30.
Hmm?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
It clearly states in the will --
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
What the hell you talking about?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
You got a nice crib here.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Aren't you going to join us?
And what's that?
All the more reason I should be here.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
We'll have to sneak in.
Lucky thing.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
We gotta jump!
Where is it?
Did you do it?
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
You were just a kid.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
I didn't sell it.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
You was just doing your job.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
We just thought...
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Jimmy Bones?
You gotta use your imagination.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
All right!  Where's the key?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where's what?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
They just left, didn't they?
It was him.  I'm positive.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
The money?  The money's gone.
But it could be anywhere.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
It's not here, Caesar.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
You can't kill me yet.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
Me?  Why?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
You're doing everything yourself?
'63 Chevy.
Thanks.
Why?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
He's a launderer?
Basically.
What?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I guess I wanted to.
Shit, here we go.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I'm not afraid of anything.
What choice?
Do you think you know me like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.
Caesar wants me to stay.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
I won't ask again.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
What is Treadstone?
Keep it. 
Who do you think sent me?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Yes.
I need a ride.
Oh, Jesus... 
I've got a situation here and --
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Listen to what you want.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Where?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
No.
-- forget it --
Who paid the bill?
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
<u>Where am I</u>?
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
I think we'd better have a look.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
What do I have to do.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
You sound worried.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Triplets.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
What is it?
Enough though, eh?
You killed him?
Yes. I'm impressed.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Trust me.
Shut up!
You stupid bastard!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
OK. What's in the parcel?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, all wars do -
Look at that - right on time.
Will you please turn back.
Don't you like parties?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Don't worry.
He is dead.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Can I forget it?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Hey - that's my desk!
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
What is it?
Mother? Is that you?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Er, yes ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
My I.D. cards.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Can you fix it?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Is this what you gave Mary?
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
No, I'd better not.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
I know him. That's Noel.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Yes.
Did you see my father?
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
Don't give me that look.
What look?
I hate vodka.
I'll drink to that.
Last show of the night.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Why?
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
You packing up tonight?
I don't think so.
Hold it down, okay?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Yes.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Good night.
Did you shoot their boots?
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Don't go.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Stop it.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
What did he say?
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
I really have to go.
Yes.  How do you know?
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
...good-bye then.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
If we could just eat first.
I trust you.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
How's it going?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Why, you need me for the story?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
What?
Where are you?
Yes.
Why?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
You want to come?
Go ahead -- what?
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Yes, I'm sorry.
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
A girl with a body like mine?
Walter can I ask you something?
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Is it murdered man?
Did you hear what he said?
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Are you ready?
Walter, I'm sorry...
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Would you pose for me for free?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
You might talk too much.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Hello, Walter.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Huh?!!!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Are you done with these?
Why not?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
I was just straightening up the place.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Nice game.
Figures.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Yes.
Which way did she go?
Dying.
He doesn't look fifty.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
What'd you dream about?
Come on, what was it?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Things are kind of confusing.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Why'd you come back?
Thanks.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
A dress.
I'm glad you came.
) What do you think?
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Why?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Yes.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
But you threw a knife at my head!
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
They were vampires?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Don't start with me again.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five?
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
No THX.
That's the plan.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
So, we're stupid now?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
My right nostril?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Fundamentals?
We lost.
--but you're father's in there!
It's Skip, for you.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I doubt that.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
It's possible.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
You need a nickname.
Who's he play for?
Will that work for me?
You missed the tag!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Fastball.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Go for it.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
I gotta go now, Dad.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
Excuse me.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Lester...
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Then he called me a faggot.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Hey, she came to talk...
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
I -
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
I just told you. She called me.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Nice to see you, Senator.
This woman's an institution.
I-I'll do it.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Yeah, I know all that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Okay?
Yeah.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
You're lower than a dog!
I was with somebody.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I wouldn't -
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
You are not threatening me anymore!
...and hypocrisy.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
You're firin' me?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
So, you're a righty?
Yeah?
I don't want to go to Europe.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Yes.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Come on. I'm sorry.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Oh.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
For what?
It's in all the papers.
Of course, Remo.
I understand.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Yeah?
Okay.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You know?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
What about my money?
All right. Be careful.
...same outfit.
It means I got the money.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Smarten up.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Yeah, thanks a lot.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
What's the matter with you?
All right, all right. But I - I -
Hi.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Guilty. I am.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
Selina, are you okay?
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
What do you want from me?
Even the skylight?
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Enough.
What did--?
Did you try to kill...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Theo wants to talk again.
You gotta just look the other way.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Lady, don't let him do it!
You missed.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You switched license plates?
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Nels?
Lady, try making some sense.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
She's gone --
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What do you mean?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Do you know what's in that box?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Yes?  Yes?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Why can't it be her?
Rachel -- Oh my God.
You're going to let them get away with this?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
You timed that beautifully.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
You could've hit me.
Stop talking like that!
Naturally.
Know what else is in here?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Who is this?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
There are no guarantees in this life.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Negative.
And then?
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who am I talking to?
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
We're gonna get there first.
Undercover.
I thought so.
Is that good or bad?
So who's he?
See that, Col?
What you think?
Maybe he wants something.
Stop it, Dil --
Thank you.
Who?
How'd you guess?
What was that?
He's getting up.
Give me that look again.
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Did he come here too?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Can't leave me now.
Sorry, darling.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
She own you, Jimmy?
Yes.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Anything.
You promise?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
You mean that?
What pills?
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Died...
More endearments.
Say it again.
Meet Col --
Stop it, Dil --
Fergus!
So what do you need, Fergus?
Horny bastard.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Was I?
You a handyman, Fergie?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I understand.
Just a girl.
Could you?
Hey --
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Do you?
Is it bad?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
See if she's all right.
Don't.
Help me.
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Hurling --
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
What about it?
You don't look so bad in this light.
What is it?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Now what?
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
Then say it.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Thanks very much.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
No, what?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Brian.
Sure.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Are you going to listen?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
You loved him?
Leave?
Swiss.
Where did he keep his money?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Are you in the book?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How do you shave in there?
What was what?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
What?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Yes -- that's right.
How do you know what they're doing?
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Yes?
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Because I don't love him.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He knows everything.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Do you know him?
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What's he up to?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
She's my daughter, Tom.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Daddy you scared me!
You said that two weeks ago.
What do you mean?
Not much further.
It was a she.
What did you hear?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
You found her?
You know where I can find her?
I can.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Yes.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
You ok?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Why?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I did.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
What are you doing?
That's what he said.
Yes.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
What?
What?

A little early for a delivery.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
And if that Elvis shit...
You want cash?
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
No.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
...up.
It happens to this piece of shit...
 Excuse me...
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
No, no, no.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
...-damn!
Take your gun!

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...Night Shift, but you might...
Whoo!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
Hey!
 Shit. 
 Go, go.
No.  Shit.
All right, let's go.

...you're dealin' with!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
So you took his...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...hospital.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
They're takin' off.
We're gonna die!
Put your hand in my pants.

Come here.
 That's why I didn't give it...
What?
Oh, shit.
  I've got the real thing!
...tunnel!
Stupid.
Shoot me. 
 There's gotta be...
They'll meet you at the top.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
...us.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Well, that just about figures for today.
Yeah, that's my truck.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
What?  Say again...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...

Went away? 
And let me guess.  You failed.
Do you know what'll...
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Closin' down, sir.

Of which we have more than enough.

There.
It's clean.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
You try anything, it goes in...
 
 ...checked. 
Goddamn it, Ma-...
...-time,  remember?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.

...son.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
My secret?
...is a perfect hunter.
...without caution...
...is death.
Call an ambulance.
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Dr.  Long!
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Mason.  Mason!
...hands!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?

Sir?
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Too bad?
No.
At my age, you tend to lose track...
What does this mean?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Where's that?
Where did you get this material?
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
You and your husband never discussed her?
Iced tea.
What?
I should talk this over with your husband.
No. I went riding rather early.
I'll stop by.
Mr. Gittes.
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Of course I'm sure.
That dam is a con job.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
And Hollis knew about it?
Is that unusual?
I'll stay.
When was the last time?
Why?
Working for the District Attorney.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Your eye.
Where?
You bastard.
I am not!
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Let me handle that.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Yeah, Sophie.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I'm sorry. We don't.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Never?
The water.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Neither do I.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
How long's it been shut?
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
I might make him nervous.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
It didn't end very well, did it?
Yes -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
What's the matter?
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
And the notice?
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Emily!
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
What's funny now?
Where's the soap?
You're very easily amused.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
A rooster?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
At night?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, it seems to me -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
You goin', Mom?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Close the door, Raymond.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
Good.
Yes?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
What's this?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yeah, all in crates.
Who told you you could sit down here?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
I think you'd better leave now.
Can I join in?
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
When did you get back?
How do you know that?
So you're really getting married?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
But you were.
There's more, isn't there?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
You're such an asshole.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Nobody. It was closed.
Are you open?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Bunch of savages in this town.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Eight and a half?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
I'm talking to myself here.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
What's that?
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
It would stand to reason, yes.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.
Wait.
What's a jizz-mopper?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Vermont?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Exactly. They drank it all.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Reach what?
I don't want to talk to you.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're lying.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
How do you figure?
Just the paper.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Are there any balls down there?!
It's not my store.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Who?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Something like thirty-six.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
I don't want Caitlin...
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I'm not out of shape!
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You hope what feels good?
You'll be missed.
How long you gonna be here?
You're not?
Willam!
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Go on, fetch.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
She's losing it!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
She's tough.
Two...
That's it, you look like a professional.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I don't expect you to understand.
Excuse me?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
You attacked me.
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Where's the helicopter?
What's your names?
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Oh, my God!
Right.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Richard Travers.
What did you do that for?
My wife... Alex freezes.
You've not been to school all week, son.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Where is he now, sir?
What job and how much?
Aye.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Religion?
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
I haven't seen you before.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
I've done my best, have I not?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Four in this block, sir.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Bottega.
Max...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
A deer?
You still carrying passengers?
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
So?  It was a random thing.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Not our call, Phil.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Try?
I brought you flowers.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Yo, whassup?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Twenty-four minutes.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
You listening to me?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Let him go, Vincent.
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's not bullshit.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
How long have you been a hit man?
No.
Some living.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
That's what you said...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
None of your business.
What happened?
Are you crazy?!
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not for years.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Surprise me.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
At a horse show.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
How'd you get the picture?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
I'm a very patient man.
That's great.  Good for you.
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
I'm not sure what you mean.
I don't know...
Excuse me?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
So, you doing anything tonight?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Do you believe me?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
What?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Tell me.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
What...
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
J39 Z186...?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
But what do I say?
Many others.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Now... you go home.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
No.  Please.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
The systems integration site.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Actually --
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
How do you mean?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
The final countdown.
What are you so afraid of?
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Git your shovel and git to work.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Yeah.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you mean, Luke?
On my own.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
That fool. That damn fool.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Back a buck.
But -- but --
No. No chains either.
What did I do?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
You bastard!
We'll get the paramedics...
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You know where.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
I think this is number three...
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Nothing.
We'll show that to...
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Then what do you need me for?
Why should I trust you?
What's that siren?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Tell me what to do!
<u>What</u>?...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Look at her legs.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
There was no sperm.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Detective Niccoletti?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Please finish your story.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
What kind of place is this?
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
What about this one?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
What do you think?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
No.
By color.
But you're checking it out.
A daisy for the lady.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
It's a good thing my family loves you.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Just checking.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Where to?
It's TV heaven.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Hey.
Good luck.
Promise?
What is it? Are you OK?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
What are we going to do?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
So, another one bites the dust.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
Can you loan me a 20?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Here's the ring.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I heard about your friend.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
You killed her!
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
You've already robbed the safe?
Where's your brother?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
I'm good.   Really.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
And for my help I would get what?
Tonight?
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
I can't believe you didn't check.
What for?
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
Guns.   Can you get them?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Everything?
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
What about transportation?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
Anybody know about that car outside?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
When do we go?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
Why?
She seems pleasant enough.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
You're back!
Then leave her to me.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
You don't seem to understand.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
How so?
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Give it back!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Go.
Good.  And how are you?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
This is a delicate matter.
No onions though, okay?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Mister Funboy.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
In a better place.  I hope.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Do you know what you destroyed?
That's ancient history.
You don't even remember...
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Miss her?
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
What do you mean?
No.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
The Fountainhead.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Need a lift?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Yes.
What are you doing?
I can't win with you.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Hi.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
That's great.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Something awful happened last night.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
It's like a secret society.
That's one way of looking at it.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
You think?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Good luck, Sebastian.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Where is she?!
Pleased to meet you.
Ronald?
I'll think about it...
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Who are you spying on?
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Where is she?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
It clearly is why.
Why so nervous?
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Ronald?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Ronald? That's crazy.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
Do you know where she is?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
The Farren house
It's early yet.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Hello, Amy.
Certain wishes do.
Can't you tell me later?
Just you wait!
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
But where do you come from?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
This is more fun than just pretend.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
Why hasn't he got a head?
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hide me? Why?
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Let the child stay.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Maybe he's just shy.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Where are all the mediums?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
What the hell is the tampon test?
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I think I just got my period.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
You're kidding, really?
My apartment's just such a mess.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Knock what off?
Uh huh. So pee.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
This really isn't a good time.
You busted me.
So what book did you buy?
I really gotta get going.
What are those?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No, why?
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
What's with the squirt guns?
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Hello?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm going to take a shower.
We can get a warrant if you like.
No, I have a cat.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
It's for you. Frida.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
He was found a few blocks away.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
What makes her think that?
His wife.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Water?
First Lady...
You're kidding?
.. Nothing.
Where's the girl?
Don't call the Vice President!
Fine.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Bob...
Just what you think I mean.
Dave -- I'm working.
And who's gonna find out?
I'm not sure.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Extend things?
Thanks, I wrote it.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
This is wrong, Alan!
And it's proving quite effective...
Something like what...
What do you mean?
... Sometimes they do.
What?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
You ever use it?
What about it?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You're kidding.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Where's home?
I don't mind.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
Hi.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I never thought I'd...
So this is it?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
Yeah.
What is the point?
What do you mean you don't know?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Oh God, it's over now!
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Who else was involved in this?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Yes... sir.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
It's Nuwanda.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
It does?  What?
Sort of.
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Isn't there an easier way?
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
But father, it's not fair.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
What is it then?
What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Come on, that's impossible.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
From you?
It's my birthday.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
How soon can we get up and running?
Seen a lot of islands?
Yeah you did...
The "come back" kind.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
...Jagger was here...I was here...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Joey...it's okay...
It's okay...come on...
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Why don't you back off?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Damn right!
That's mustard!
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
It won't open.
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
See, I'm going home.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
You like to call me Linda now?
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Not so good.
No?
You Biederman?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Biederman!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
You're going hunting?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
C'mon. I've got the car.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I want to go home, Merle.
I just wait. You know?
You think about it?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
What'd he say?
From Nam?
It's ahead, by the tree.
I'm doing that too.
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets.
How's Linda?
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Great. Hey. That's great.
What?
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
That's who.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Down.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You're working a partner on this.
I don't want to hear anymore.
How do I look?
But Sergeant...
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
...What are you talking about...?
No.  I want to be with you.
I'll take it.
And what about Daniel Webster?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Belle.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
No, you're not.
What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
Yes.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Who is it?
Well -- what are we going to do?
Jabez!
Why don't they come --
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Let him try it.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
What's that?
You aren't angry with me?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I'm John McClane.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
It's okay, it's okay.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
No, sir.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
What are you going to do?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
The code key, please...?
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you're an American?
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Three down, four to go --
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Al?  Al, you there?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Well, how'll I get home?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He's makin' threats in there.
I can't talk to him.
I'm afraid.
I got Sal.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
... armed robbery ...
He wanted to kill me!
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Believe me, I'm on your side.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
You got kids?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
I'll be God damned if you will.
I didn't eat any pizza.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You shouldn't start now.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
He's gone?
It's the cops.  Shit!
I want him to think that.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
Sonny -
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Oh - Maria!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
We can't stay here.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
No!
Did Pop come down?
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
You could give up.
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
What is it, Choco?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Is that you, Domino?
God help us. God help us all.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
What did he say about the arm?
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Fast and or furious.
I be.  I'm living large.
I don't like anything else.
I'm gonna leave now.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Mookie.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Make it plain.
It's been about a year.
What can you say?
Good morning.
Where did you sleep?
How old are you?
My name is Eddie.
Jade.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
How are you holding up in this weather?
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Can ya dig it?
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
I would like to get paid now.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
Sal, I want my money.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Do we now?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
OK.  OK.
I work too, but I still make time.
Before I get off work.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Tina, you're sweating.
To get my money.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
You talk to 'em.
I didn't know you could read.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
You really think so?
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
I didn't think so.
Pop asked you.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Come over around seven.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What are you wearing?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
I go to school where I live.
Oh, is this your special place?
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Collins is a great man!
Nice jugs.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Who's your partner?
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
But-
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Me, me, me!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
Am not.
I... found that rock.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Yes, what?
What are you doing?
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
How was that?
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
I am strong!
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
Times two.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Where is it?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Are you going to kill her?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Paul!!  Paul!!
Is he....?
He knows.
Run!
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Where?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Don't you bave a car?
But you're a big star!
Do you want me to get it for you?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Let me take you to the hospital.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
What is this place?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Um, okay... roll camera
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
H-how'd you know?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Better than not getting a job?
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Raising money is tough.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Um, I guess --
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
I just picked them up on the way over...
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
What was that?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
I can't get it to go up.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Did you see that?
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
You think she really likes him?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Leave her be.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
What?
Tell me.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Mm.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
St. Joseph's.
What happened?
But Al is your husband now!
Hi. Is Shari here?
No.
She left.
I can't?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
What does this mean?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Cream rinse?
Really?
Um...
Everybody hates me!
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
I got your message. Way to go!
All right.
Great.
You watching the ballgame?
Check forging.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
We don't have foibles.
Sign here, please.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
But you haven't written your novel.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Thank you.
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah, just --
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
What a surprise.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
I hope so
Jim, where the hell have you been?
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
So... what do you have to tell me?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Could you get this? I can't
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
What do you want, Jim?
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
And she's super-nice
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
Where 're you going?
These are private -- these are for us.
I don't care.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Can I sign yours too?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
That obvious, huh?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Captain, what do you want?
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Give me one minute.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
What happened?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Lynn.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
You wanted to meet here?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Thanks, but no thanks.
More.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
What do you mean?
More or less.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
And now you'll provide them.
<u>No</u>.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
No.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
You make a mistake?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
No.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Pacific Coast Bell.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Brill?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Clear as day.
When can you get it here?
It is?
What kind of a question is that?
Okay.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
<u>Here</u>?!
Gimme that.
You're driving.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if--
Feeling lucky?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
What size?
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About the accident.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Bobby!
Right.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
What?
Yeah.
Stacy?
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Sir?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
That ain't me.
You don't know who the fuck--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Actually, that's not true.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
He doesn't work that way.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
You got a minute?
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Bobby--
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Really?
Where've you been?
How long can you stay?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Bobby--
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
What does that have to do with you?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
What happened?
The originals?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Lyle?!
Dean's with Lyle.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
Then let's assume I don't.
Hello!  Good morning.
Excuse me?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What do you mean, poetry?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
I'd like you to have them.
You should come into the shelter.
This is not very good, is it?
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
When were you most happy?
What?  No!
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Dance with me.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
What did you do?
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Why do they care about our maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
How are you?
David Caravaggio.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
I can already see.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
No!
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
So I follow the wires?
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Kip - come and dance with me
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
He's gone, hasn't he?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Katharine!
I'll come with you.
What are you talking about?
No.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
That's doable.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
Don't overestimate yourself.
He's on to something bigger.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if I try humility.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Are you...okay?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I've got something...
Well, no...but...
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
You can't.
You want me to pick up a painting?
What the hell do I do now?
I'm a thief. Sue me.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
On what? Another job?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Charged?
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Camera in the--
It's a party.
Ready?
Careful...careful.
Okay, you're a thief.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
You've got everything planned.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
There's always a surprise.
Charged.
You shouldn't have.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The disc is still in there.
Jesus.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
This is just show and tell.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Call it an expression of trust.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Tony Marvin.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Out to lunch with the girls.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
I don't know what to say.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Ross.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
It happens all the time.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Yeah.
She's one of the sick people?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
I do.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
What are you doing here?
What?  But you been working so hard --
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Uh-huh?
Who's Baxter?
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
He can do it.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You won't.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks at his master.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
And what are they, pray tell?
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Now you're making sense.
What is it?
Yes, you do.
What are you afraid of?
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
You look silly.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
A tremor!
But I feel The Force flowing!
And we can watch ...
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
They look pretty docile.
Humans?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Where is he?
What?
Where's Plissken?
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Locked.
75% power.
Plissken...?
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Where'd they go?
Is that what I think it is?
What're you doing in here?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Who?
How do we get out of here?
The freeway.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
Who is Merlin?
I want to thank you.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Yes.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
A lovestruck page!
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
What honey?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Burke.
What is it?
But it's clean?
No. No rats.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A man to see you.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
That depends.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Please.
Are you sure?
In Europe.
I wouldn't talk.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
You like him.
Why does God let us get tired?
Hi Chris. Great party.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
I came to say goodbye.
Sure.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
Intensely.
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
Let the enemy have no power over her.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Her heart.
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Really?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Yeah, a fall.
It's possible. Possible however…
Is that a threat?
Who's in it?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Yes?
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
I don't know.
Honey ...
You the magician?
Oh my God ...
Am I late?
Fuck him.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
You look awful.
Only on odd days.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
Nice, huh?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Awe inspiring.
Come on, stand still.
How about these?
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Yeah.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Yeah.
How dare you say you love me.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Two hours ago!
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
She's a big girl.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
Expensive hangover.
You always threw up.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
Nothing. We get nothing.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Jack, you're on television.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
What?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Right.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
So what'd you think?
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Just call me a cab.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
The flu.
I'm sorry?
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
Ready?
What's the problem?
It's orange!
Come on.
Oh, thanks.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Huh?
Is that important?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
No.
Baker.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Frank works hard.
Forget it.
So why's he do it?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
How's egghead?
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Nina?
Friend.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Must've been a cheap date.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Yeah... No.
Hi.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Sounds big.  What's he do?
The recent past.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Why not?
What's a prom?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
He's lying.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Where am I?
Nice-looking kid.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
I'm late for surgery.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
How did he expect to do that?
I took it from my fake husband.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
-- Castor?
They're too tight.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
You've got someone in your office.
You merciless bastard!
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
The hospital.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
... That's great.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Kate Reynolds...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Got it.  Good tip.
Big Ed’s.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Is it morning yet?
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
Is it...?
Damn...
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Yeah?  What do you need?
I've got everything I need.
What?!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
How much time?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Like the dress...?
It’s lovely...
Evelyn, right?
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.
Uh huh...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Thanks, Jack...
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
Say it, Jack...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Okay...
I could stay here forever...
A perk for what?
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
That’s the one...
Jesus, Jack...
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
I need you, tiger..
Peter Lassiter...
Damn...damn...damn...
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
What about his first born?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
But all these people...
You're hot!
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Which was?
For science.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Where do we stand?
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Cora.
He's making a fine recovery.
We're pushing oxygen today.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Doctor, what's wrong?
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
You left something out.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
How does it look, Doctor?
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Sabotage? I don't understand...
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sort of.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
Huh?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Officer Olson.
White Bear Lake?
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Mm.
Uh-huh.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
You bet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
...Babe the Blue Ox?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
My patience is at an end.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Are you calling Stan?
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
Stan and I're okay.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
Well, they -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
The heck d'ya mean?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Yah.
How's it look, Marge?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Well, they're a good outfit.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Better times.
Nope.
Margie Olmstead?
What'd he say?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
We've got a -
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Was it reasonable?
It's just the three cent.
Uh-huh.
Well -
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Who do you think could've done this?
No, you can't die of insomnia.
We need to talk.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Looks like this is goodbye.
How did you find me?
I'm just on my way out...
There?
You... don't have to... leave.
Hear what?
... A person.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
What is wrong with you?
You got about thirty seconds.
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
How have you been?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
No, supply oxygen?
I mean -- for a living.
What?
I don't... think so.
I don't follow...
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
Call what off?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
What car?
Alive or dead?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What are you doing?!
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
You're too young.  Sorry.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Four in Milwaukee.
This isn't possible...
You have jobs.
I'm pulling the green wire.
I quit.
What?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Do something for me.
Very good, Sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Ain't that something?
Yesssss...
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Animals.
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
You have to tell us now.
Please, what else could it mean?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Random, sure.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Whoa, nine months?
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
What is it?  What are you?
Sure.
I'm... really sorry.
Stop the car!
Police are coming.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Cuticle lacerations.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Again.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
I've seen worse places.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
American?
You never been in one of those things.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Can you handle the door gun?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
John.  My name is John.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
How long before you're fully on line?
You think they'll find any?
Who're you?
This your stuff?
Will it hurt?
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
No really..I can't.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
The moron?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Tragedy?
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Have I died?
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
... Do you know who I am?
The Little...
They work for Him.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Will you shut-up!!!
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
No just Parry.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
Divorced.
Serveza yourself!
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Okay, Ray...
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Washington.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
You want me to hold the chicken.
Now don't...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
How long have you been staying here?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Uhm hmm.
With applesauce?
I think he's got a terrific personality.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Thank you.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Robert?
Four or five years.
What?
Robert, I think you better just...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Well, she was.
Fine.
Why you have an attitude for?
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
What?
Yo.
Wussup, Victor.
They are?
Where you goin'?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Yeah.
What she look like?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Not really.
You live around here?
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
What?
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I wasn't asking.
You're lucky.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
So what do you figure?
No idea at all?
Jesus.
The two surfer boys?
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Oh my God!
That's it?
Wait a second --
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Has he?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
I know.
They bust you every week.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
I'm all ears.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Yo!
'Magic' today, huh?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
You doing a story on this guy?
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Lunch...
He never sees them and I never met them.
No.
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm terrified.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
No wonder.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I commend him on his choice.
Where is she?
She moved out.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
I don't know.  Look!
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Utah?
What about finding the source?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
I want something I can print!
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Not really?
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Who's Frieda?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
No, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Who's your decorator?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Excuse me?
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Thanks for the promotion, man.
You going to be okay?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Ah, an obvious choice.
Hello, Ford...
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Pretty smooth, huh?
Ouch.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
'Bye, Johnny...
Everything is everything.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
What's your name, asshole?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Man, I'm clean.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Who is that guy?
Toy wit' this will ya.
Suspicion of what?
Yeah.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Pass.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
You know what I'm saying.
What I know is what I told you.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
You're shitting me!
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
He did.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
How's that?
Okay, start pedaling.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
You call your son Little Chief?
You just burned the desk.
I don't know.
I lost you.
When?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
She just died, your mother just died?
October 22, 1969.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
Whatta you mean...
What do I tell them?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What...
John, you there?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Go in where?
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
You work too hard, John.
I look familiar?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
What is that?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Somebody was in here.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
It's deceiving.
What happened that night?
Is... is everything all right?
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Bullseye!
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You don't "have to."
What?
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
I've seen it.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Sorry.
Yeah...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
That's disgusting.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Dear Christ...
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Very big.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
What was it like?
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
Don't wait Efor me.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Shoot him.
What do you mean?
I talked to her two days ago.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
First you tell me.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
See, Daddy.
Opening night, Lillian.
And you've been extremely patient.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Where the hell are you?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Where's your elastic brace?
I know, Pop.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Sidney.
Yes, Peter.
What?
I don't know.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Are you sure?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
"Hell!"
A -- a week.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
And Jinnah?
You've done me a great service.
I would rather march.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
You're an extraordinary man.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Have you read his magazine?
You almost sound like you believe that.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Grudges?
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
What are you waiting for?
How often do you test, Director?
Often.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
What's wrong with it?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
It's not too late to back out.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
What makes them think that?
In a corridor.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
What will happen to the others?
German, is that you?
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
We were just looking.
Why are we leaving?
What's this, Lamar?
You gotta be kidding.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Hello, McCoy.
What about your wife?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
We'll try again.
Hello, Doc.
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Assumed name... Houston.
I'll be okay.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
For exits off Main Street.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
They checked in.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
How long ago.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Only one car.
How much?
We better stick here till tonight.
We're going to make it.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Oh, Jesus... how?
You okay?
Where do we go from here?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Are we going to make it?
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Hope you get to where you're going.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Two.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Drive.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Come on. How much?
You do what he says, Harold.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
A couple of weeks back.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Yes. I told him.
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
Good evening.
Though nicer than most?
What?
Yes. I met him last year.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Not entirely. No.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Yeah.
Working at Woolworths.
You all right now?
What?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
What you having, Jack?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Will this do?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
You sod.
What'll they do to him?
What about Keith?
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Are you awake?
They're friends of mine.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, you've been watching television.
What's it to you anyway?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Not suede boots!
You're bluffing, you bastard!
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
I had to.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Well, I think I had one once.
You did?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
I...
What hard part?
They...
They have...
Yes.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
What did he say?
A buck a shot.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
What?  What?  The leads.
Me?
...you don't have to come in...
...I thought that we were only talking...
Absolutely.
Clear...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Did they...?
No.
I don't want to go to lunch.
You have a problem?
Shelly, you blew the last...
...after the thirtieth...
Murray said...
...ah, fuck this...
I'm out.
I will close.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Mmm.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Excuse me...
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
No.  It hadn't.
Uh-huh?
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
I've got the check...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Why?
You did that?
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Dave...
That's right.
Shelly...!
Fuck her...
What is it?
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Home cooking...
Go ahead.
What?
I've got to talk to you.
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
You tell me again.
No, Jim.
I can't regotiate.
What does that mean?
I...
What power?
The power to negotiate.
The deal.
What?
And the check is...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
You did?
...you want to go out today...?
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
I can't.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Connie.
No.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
The children can stay.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I understand...
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
It was hard to have him killed.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
But, you told me yourself...
He's an Italian?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Rocco!
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I asked about Fredo?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
This committee owes an apology!
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
On a plane back to Sicily.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
However I can help you...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to settle on their terms.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
What was that?
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
I'm not a kid.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
A homo?
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
And your name is --?
Just that I was in the Marines.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
You went to university?
But why?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
So you had a wife?
What way might that be?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
But we have to match the other sketch.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
What was that about?
Who's that?
Is that really her?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
It's not like her.
I'm very sorry.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
You okay?
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
What are you doing here?
Yes.  Perfectly.
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
I don't mind.
Quite.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
What kind of job... ?
Yeah -- ?
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Get out --
Consider me gone, Detective --
Who is it -- ?
Where you been, anyway?
It just ain't happening --
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
C'mon, man ...
You mean the poor --
Peugot convertible ...
No.
I know...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
You goin' home?
Sure -
Kip -- ?
You all right -- ?
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
"Shadow games?"
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
I know ...
Sure, man --
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Hospital.
How's it going?
Call 911 -
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Six or seven...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Cut 'em...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What -- ?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Look at Jeannie's kid.
What? What happened?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Wha?  Me?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
I don't care. Something's going on.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
It's been six months.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What'll I tell Fran?
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
Where'd you find such creeps?
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
No way! You're kiddin'!
What are we gonna do up there?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Gone.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Oh...
Oh, right.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
How much money you got?
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
What's up guys?
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Oh, I'm sorry.
--Half-red, half-black--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Hey, how you doin'?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Yes.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
I live right around the corner.
I think so.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--And confuse him--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Hello, Sean.
I got one of those too.
About thirty million to one.
What's the point?
What do you want to do?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
You think so?
This is a real piece of shit.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Why not?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Do you think you're alone?
Not to me, they're not.
Don't give me you line of shit.
What?
I been there. I played my hand.
The wrench, why?
I know.
See ya.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yes you were.
I've never seen your place.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
What?
Then what are you afraid of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Yeah.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Twenty days work, oh boy!
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Naw. They paroled me.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Four.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Joad. Tom Joad.
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
You got dances too?
Say, who runs this place?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
They never wrote you nothing?
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
What you figger to do?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
What's the matter? What's happened?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
We gonna live here?
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Know where we're a-goin'?
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
But who done it?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Here we go!
You people looking for work?
You do not.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Do you want to get a drink first?
Shoulda brought my gun.
--She's not dead---
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
What stuff?
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
If he does our job, he's our job.
No...
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
You have a headache?
Yeah...
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
He gave me a great deal.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
This is Annie MacLean.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I have a way with animals.
Need a lift?
The answer's no.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
No, you didn't.
Mom?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
You buckled up?  You cold?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Did he mention it?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
What did you say?
When? Tonight?
Yes. We're suing.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Why did you go?
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
And you think it's best if I don't come.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
I don't understa-
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
What?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Ha...
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Don't be such a baby!
Hey, darlin'.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
What do you mean?
You think it's cool?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
And what's he do?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Yes!
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
Yeah.
Name your stakes.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Shit!!
There they are!
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Uhhhmm...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Never fear. I is here.
Die, dickweeds!
Virus?
So?
You're late.
We need to talk.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
We've been better.
Brady!
When did this happen?
An accident?
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You guys always look great.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I don't want to.
Hi.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Had enough?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Don't you mean what you do best?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
This is 132, over.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Okay.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
We just talked.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Shit!
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
I've already lost it.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I wasn't spooked.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Fancy.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
A man wouldn't do that...
Jesus!
Exactly what do you need?
TOTALLY!
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
What about the bogyman?
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
There's nothing else I can do.
PROBABLY going.
What did you use before?
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Well, let's do it.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Yeah.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
When did you first notice this?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
How's everything?
Oh, yeah.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
This is not an easy situation.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
They're fantastic.
Where're you going?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Are you angry with me?
I didn't say that.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
I am... I did slave all day.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Are you sure?
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Elliot lusts after you.
Why?
Because I have to!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Oh, great.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Oh!
...you know?  I, uh...
Mh-hm.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Singing?
Ohh!
Can we, can we go?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Yeah?
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
Yeah.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Mickey?
Mmm, what?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
...read it over, and think about it.
...I was <u>working</u>...
It wasn't my day.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Yeah, so where is he?
Impossible.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...are you alright, sir...?
I like Popcorn...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Yes, I did.
Why?
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
...what's he got against you?
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
What is that supposed to mean...?
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
I'm an orphan.
I said how's your baby...?
My husband brought it to me from America.
...should love to correct your error. 
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
Yes.  How did you know?
Darling...
Who does not?
Make them eat the figurine.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...I'm sorry....?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Why?
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Then we cannot go.
What shape is the scar?
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I don't understand.
I..
Yes.
...why?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
You think you're so...but you're just...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
No.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody. I know                         ] you like to think of yourself as                            ] the Anti-Oberon, but man, you're                            ] getting just as spooky.

That would be a No.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I just never thought of you in that...
So what?                                                    ]
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
I think your passion is terrific.
Do you really not believe in God?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Don't say that.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Good plan.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Perrier water!
Did not.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Look, Mother!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
That's coming along well!
She's terribly hurt . . .
You're such an incredible woman.
John has fallen in love with me!
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Of course, yes.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
Really? Do tell.
How much time off?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
You could say that.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Are you ready?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You got a drinking problem or what?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
The homeless!
You!
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
I didn't ask him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
You test each one thoroughly?
How are they with kids?
Well, it's for a woman.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Baby, what is it?
Uh huh.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
Have you just plain asked him?
And?
Here, take this out to the table.
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Neil, calm down.
What?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
What?
Did you hear what he said?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Do you remember who gave us this?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
The cab's waiting!
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
And I can't help having a cold.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
It's a double.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Detective Bedsoe.
No.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I'm leaving.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
Living.  Remember?
It will be a good harvest this year.
Aye?
A lucky guess.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You got me.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
I'll be fine.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
You didn't answer my question.
Yes -- it is.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
So?
Would you like to see it?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
Must you fight him?
He's in there!
Be careful, Conner.
We're holding the workers down below.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I like my work.
It will not end tonight.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
No.
I'll no forget you.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Fine.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
What'd you find out?
You should warn them, Sonny.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
It's over.  We have to give up.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
How did you get this number?
Ow!  Shit!
Thanks for the shirt.
What do you want?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
That's not enough.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
You have her cell number?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Are all of you named Jones?
Is my daddy okay?
What do you want me to do?
He has lots of disks.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Who is it?
What do you want?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
What do you mean by that?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
You want to pay me?
Give me it.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites.
The high command? Our high command?
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
He did.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I will see what I can do.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
I'll be over.
Where are they going?
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Satellite feed.
When will they be here?
Are you sure this is the river road?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Promoted. House Manager.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Call, sir?
Our cards, please.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Thomas wants advice?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No.
How can we help him.
But who is left?
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to go out to get food.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
A car.
What sort of car?
A Volkswagen.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
What's wrong?
Twelve are dead.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
The staff, the guests.
Why the hurry, Roger?
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
So what stopped her?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
What?
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
What's in there?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Pritchett, is that you?
I don't think so...
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
Price!!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Really? Well, let it rip.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
-- my loss --
I think...I may have the answer.
What're you talking about?
Well, I don't.
-- confirming everything we already know --
Please! I need your help.
The lockdown thing.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Something....happened --
It might have been her mother.
What will they tell you?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
I can't move!
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
What is it?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Who?
What are you talking about?
What?
Are you all right?
I think we should do it.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
What was she afraid of?
The rain is letting up.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Where did you find this?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I know what I saw.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Wha .... ?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
I'm trying to quit.
Did you know him?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Every day.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Terri?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
You gonna buy?
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
JP?
I miss you too.
Really?
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Alex, are you....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
Oh, you read that.
What have you been doing?
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Where did you get this?
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Oh Hudson...
I hope you know what....
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
The Shazzammeter!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Adenoids?
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Ol' satchel-butt...
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
...You know! For kids!
...I'm sorry.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Every year?
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.
Sez who?
I filed it yesterday.
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Muncie.
I got big ideas, though!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
But, buddy --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
...It is?
Geez, I --
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
You're fired.
How's that, Sid?
There's one in every story.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
What's this?
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
You mean a figurehead.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I've never heard of a cure.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
It is not beautiful.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I love Fort Holland.
I told you.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
An accident at the mill?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Yeah, that one.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Damn it, Ben --
I'm not.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
About?
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
See you.
Yeah?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
You're not a psycho!
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
It's really quite all right.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
How'd you know?
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
But not too ashamed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
How can you do that man?
Am I right or am I right?
Shit. You're not planning --
Just be careful.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
The Idiot?
Maybe you should have just a half.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Who said so?
No one.
Yeah?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Charles.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Her name's Libbets.
And?
Hey Wendy.
Mikey was looking for you.
The ones you built?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Do it again.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
It's legitimate.
I know.
Thanks.
He would have liked that.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Good.
No.
Where you signed this?
One word to I.A. and he walks.
No way.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
I told you I don't remember.
Ran like hell to go to him...
I was her best friend.
Hey...
No...
What was?
No game.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
Your lover.
If you say so. You are innocent.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
She is.
Are these not the answers you came for?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
I'm not your daughter.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Don't Louis --
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Louis, look at me.
It can't be -
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Never.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
Fascination...
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Lestat!
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Well, what a lucky break for me.
How did you do that?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Is that bad?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
What about a radio?
Stupid. Stupid.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
But, he said he'd try.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Karla!
What do you mean?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
I love it here.
Who?
The shower again?
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Is there a problem here?
How's Julie?
Well, I'm in school and --
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Goodbye.
You're just talking nonsense.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I felt he did not like me.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
Her name is Thea?
Her family name?
Your daughter is ill.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
Why in the world can't you?
Then foreclose!
But they're somebody's children.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
You what? To save me?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
No.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
What?
She's . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hiya, George!
Is this the place?
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Mother . . .
I know –– I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
What gives?
George, can I see you for a second?
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Yes, sir.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Neither am I.
You may kiss my hand.
Didn't you tell her?
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
Oh, Mary . . .
Have fun.
Hi.
Mary! Mary!
You forgot something.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Wheee!  Faster!
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Someone pop your balloon?
Where're we going?
Coming up!  Give way!
You coming up on him?
How long ago?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
I'm going.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Michael.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
May I have this dance?
It came up during the meeting.
You don't make enough.
What's that supposed to mean?
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound?
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Why?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Let's get the kid home.
Eat Cheerios.
For me?
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Do you?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Martin, it could be anything.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Can I go with you today?
Ready?
Terry!  You okay?
Shut up.
The wind drift is lateral.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
I'm not sure I can.
I thought you were grounded.
What's wrong?
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Quiet!  Shhh!
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
I'll need more men to look.
What is it, 97 days?
Yeah.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
What's wrong?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Michael, the sub's dead.
And leave me down here???
You're going down there again?
Yes.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Yes.  It's faster.
So tell Calvin.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Michael, you're not going down there.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
You look like an orange worm.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
A piece of pie on Sunday.
They still seem nervous.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
This is where to be.  High and dry.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Make sure you put this back.
Yeah, poor bastard.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Come on, let's go.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
But you always let me....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
We need milk....
We need beer....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
That....
The fish.  Check it....
Yes!
You can stay in my room.
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I'm just getting started....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
All you all right?
I have to get this finished.
Why'd you come out here?
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
Yes I can....
Grab your socks....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Can't this thing go any faster?
Yeah....
She's a tough lady....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
I don't know shit about electronics....
How long have you known Hoagie?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
It'll work....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Oh, Jake... 
When he has a pillow over his head....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Oh no--
Be my guest. What you got?
What do you think?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
So am I. But where's my money?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
I'm asking it.
What exactly you doing, John?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Have you got a print from the hand?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
That's bullshit,
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
No.
Oh.
Really? What did he say?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
You do?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
You think John would like it?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
He's happy, darlin ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
This can't be happening to me.
Oh Jerry.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Oh come on --
Well, thanks.
Oh no.
No no. I knew.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Oh good.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Well -- this would be goodnight.
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Oh, thank you.
I got it.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
What's that supposed to mean?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Marcee --
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
You wanted smaller.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Shut up!!!
We can't just...
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
How much weight have you lost?
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Nothing.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Eric! Are you here?
I don't remember
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
PAUL!
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Absolutely not.
That does sound lucky.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
A well-accepted theory.
In Costa Rica?
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Amanda!
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
It matches the pictures.
You hear something?
Any damage?
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Well, is he?
What?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
Their what?
Our chance to do what?
?!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
You think this is all a joke?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
But would we get the phones back?
They are?  I'll be damned.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
And what are those?
Dr. Grant!
It's anti-nature.
Yes?
He sends his apologies.
In a box under my seat.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
So am I going to help you with your foot?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Go, go, go, jump!
The kids okay?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe.
All night?
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
I really think we should go back...
What?
It's still on.
What happened?
You think that's going to work?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
What's that?
About ten minutes.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
A man must eat --  And drink.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Did you see him?
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
... My ... social situation?
I usually take lunch by the River.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
What's funny?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
What of it?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Why were you given notice?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
This is filed incorrectly!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Then that's the place for us!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Give it back!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
What about him? Yes.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Guess!
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Didn't want you.
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
Oh no.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes -- all right --
Who?
-- Tuscarora --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- OK --
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Can't you get him?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
How?
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You and I -- a relationship.
About what?
What?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I better keep looking.
Well as a matter of --
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Nobody's seen that.
He's in his room, playing.
What does?
When is mommy coming back?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
I hate it.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
Yeah?
Daddy?
Wow!
Yep.
No, she never did.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes.  Very much.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Is that...permanent?
Yes.
Were you?
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
He looks like a terrific kid.
You want what?!
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
I lost him?  I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
What?!  She wants what?!
You ever see her talk to the walls?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I understand.
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Ted, I just heard...
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
And you have horses? You love horses.
I will buy them for you.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
I miss my brother.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Britain?
America, we shall see.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Did you ever doubt it?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I have more men.
It is a story, you decide.
I want to go down there.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
You are unharmed?
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
Why are we landing?
Keystone what?
We are here on official business.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
They don't really attack underwater and--
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
At school they'd always say "go" first.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Where?  Where?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Are you sure?
Excuse me?
No.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Like little children.  You okay?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Really--
He's floating.  Take it home.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You said nobody came in here!
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
With what?
What is this?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
They're coming right in.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Hey.
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
Part of our research--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I understand.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
That wasn't me.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Why not?
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
All that detail, just from memory...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
I don't know. Is it?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
No. We just -
All right, then tell me how -
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Of course it counts. How do you play?
We leave in the morning?!
Why didn't you bury those people?
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
When? How?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Fort Edward, then?
Ottawa!
And if we're unlucky?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
What a place for them...
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Such as...?
You mind if I take a look at this?
He did.
Why Sixpack?
Was there such a thing?
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
We're getting out of here just in time.
You did good...
What?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
We're on backup air.
Something wrong, Cobb?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Charge set?
Twenty minutes...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
You got money in this tub?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
A what?
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Bacon, see what we got.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
I thought this was a pub.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Have you counted the money?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
It's not him, Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
What they like then?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
No.
That's it all done, we are off.
You what? What are you on about?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
That you, boy?
I want your bar.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
What's left over?'
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
How many feet?
You jerk--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
They're not going to jail.
They stole our land--
Please.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. Not at all.
So you knew this young man before?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
So is Buddy on your short list?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
Do I seem jumpy?
You were in a fight--
Best part of the job.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
What?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad--?
Homework?
Tanks, huh?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
You own this place?
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Mikey--
Seriously.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
You get much of that in here?
And people make their choice--
Protection?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
--Santiago.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Well, you hire illegals--
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
I don't mean Fernando.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Three months.
Murdered him?
He's all yours.
Field trip?
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
You'd do a good job.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Right.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Harry.
I can be very persuasive.
Why?  Because he had you?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
What did you find?
Oh Christ.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
No.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
And they all came...
Are you all right?
I've got to help him.
You can't.
Don't look.
Bad show last night?
He got up and walked.
Whose is the car?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Philip Swann?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Does anybody?
Yeah.  You could say that.
The Puritan?
That.
For an introduction.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
He's better off this way.
That's where we're all going.
One question.
No.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
What about you? Why are you here?
What do you do?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Hello?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Oh.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
That's ok.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
That's too scary.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Where'd you grow up?
I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
I'm sorry.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
When are you coming home?
Tomorrow.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
See you later.
Will you please stop smoking?
John! What are you doing here?
Oh no...
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
I don't know.  What are they?
Must be a spare set.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You fucking bastard.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I'll bet.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
What?!?!
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Yes, I know.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Yeah.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
What's this?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
What's the matter with you?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
That's not funny
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Don't curse.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
The blue.
Okay.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
What?
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
You might be the only one with a job.
No one's forcing her.
They ever love you back?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
What?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
I don't.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Why?
What'd it say?
What?
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Quincy...
Hey.
You forgot to be there.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
You're what?
When did you decide all this?
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
What's going on?
I'll play you.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
And what happens when you lose?
Zeke.
What's that, not great?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Why not?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
After five years.
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Honey.
uh...uh...What is it?
For what?
Wilson.
ok.
Yeah.
Yeah.
-- do you wanna cup?
You take cream or sugar?
-- is not my boyfriend.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Eight o'clock?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Great, bye.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
Yeah, of course.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
Say what you want and you'll see --
What's your name?
C'mon guys, settle down --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
No.
I was listening --
What's up?
What happend?
Do you have love in your heart?
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
....do you know who I am?
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
I paid you back.
You don't need braces.
Do you wanna sit down?
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
There's no asshole like you.
Do me a personal favor --
Who are you gonna call?
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
-- just to clarify --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
And that's what you've heard?
Why does that sound silly?
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
It's not your given name, right?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
When did he go off chemo?
Oh yeah.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I AM CALM.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
What the hell is this Marcie?
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
I won't.
Come home soon after the show.
Did you tell her?
Yeah.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Was there anyone that I know?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I love you so much.
She's asleep.
Yes.  What's your name?
Want me to wake her up?
Do you still have to do homework?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
What are you doing?
yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
What do you do?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
C'mon, man.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
Alright.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
I have money.
What -- ?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Aramis, this will never --
Bloody hell...
So what has changed?
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
But why?
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
It's been too long.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Silence!  I order you!
Your Majesty...?
... You knew you had a double?
... The ball... Continue.
What number, on the first page?
Magnificent valor...
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Sire, I --
Cooperate?
So what?
Yeah?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Find out for me.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Captain?
No...
Why did you set me up?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Holy shit -
And?...
I killed them.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
No.  It wasn't like that!
That's when it happened?
Could he handle a direct contact?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
In thirty-five minutes.
Book code?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Last two like this we had, you caught.
The mark? Yes.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
I'll pick you up in...
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
There has to be.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
What?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
I'll take you.
You worked out well.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
It's me.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
I don't want to know.
Yes.
Do you see?
Yes.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Dr. Chilton.
Do you have it?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Linda King's desk.
Hi, Linda. ..
Linda doesn't come in nights.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's right-handed.
He's misunderstood.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What about the dog?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Molly?
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Do you remember what you said?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
Then why?
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
What's this Mama shit?
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Lt. Fisk said...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
How did it happen?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Why does it feel good?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
But wasn't it funny?
My hair is coming out.
Andy!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Twenty!
Cue the commercial!
Hi...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
I was very original!
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
That was a really hot house!
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Where?
What's your name?
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Weird.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
What are you doing?
... Yeah.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
I need an exit!  Fast!
I got you.
Morpheus...
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
What do you know?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
More important than what is when?
When?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
How?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
What's funny?
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
My name is Trinity.
Why?
But an Oracle can.
Are you worried?
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
I have to.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Neo, how did you do that?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
See who?
What are you talking about?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Operator.
You're not far from Cypher.
Tank, you're hurt.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Waddaya think?
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
Hey...you got nothing here.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Out!!!!
Stripper?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
What was it?
Wha?
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Sure...He lives there?
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Scumbag--
Sal!... fourteen street.
Just keep him quiet.
You ate?
That's your name?
He's coming.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
What, honey?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I wasn't going to say --
But what?
What are you eating.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
We have an arrangement now.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Here...
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
No.
Who are we talking about?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
A voice?
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Didn't the family get together last night --?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
Oh yes, I do.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Yes...
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I am, too.
Girlfriend?
You're here?
...No.
Well -- I --
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
I'm still here.
Susan --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
I won't.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
No --
Good morning, Bill.
It is a deal?
Yes, Bill.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Truly - uh - splendid.
I'm sorry, Bill --
'Fish'?
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
I'm her father!
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Uh --
I'm sorry, Bill --
So that's what love is?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
Please.  Talk to me --
What do you mean?!
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Watch it!
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Eddie?
We're all here, Bill --
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
How did you know?
Drew told me.
You like him, don't you?
Do you love Drew?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
47.
66.
Slam it?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it?
Burt.
Amnesia?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Yeah, I remember you.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
You think you can bargain with me?!
Don't remember.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Yes.
Did you?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Who?
I'm not.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
There's a dress code?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
This is your car.
Mr Gammell?
You said you were leaving town.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Who?
I don't think so.
Natalie? Natalie who?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Yes, I will.
You won't remember!
Your name's Teddy.
What was it for?							   *
* Thank you.							    *
They'll kill Gina.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
It goes very fast.
Later!  Do you dance?
Like...?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
To the limit.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where'd you go?
Verdado.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
As in...?
I am asking.  You to me.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Have faith.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
...and thanks for the flowers.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do you care?
Alonzo...
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Yeah, oh yeah.
I ain't sleepy.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
I'm scared.
Who?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Gin's okay.
What d'you want?
You want me to leave?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Uh, yessir.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
You got it.
'Figgers.
Where?
Shit.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Just got some news on Bell.
What?
I think I've been poisoned.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Know what?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Who got the Frenchman out?
Lady...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Yeah...?
Weird shit...?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Can we get this car there?
The kid's with them!!
He's special.
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
We're no leaving you!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Maybe they lied to you.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
What-
Your arm, you can't...
It bit you.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Will I be able to walk?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
No, what is it?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Thank you so much.
Done?
Show me the way?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Well, it certainly says you.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Maybe.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Did they win?
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Not much luggage.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
What are you talking about?
Where?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Exactly where is she?
How much longer before you can reach him?
Indeed.
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
And that's the only reason?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Like what?
Twice.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
'Terrorists?'
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Something else?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I do.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
By asking me.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Always.
Krieger.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
There was nobody on the bridge.
You're sure about this?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Two cars.  Where are you?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Certainly Ethan.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why should I?
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
I thought I'd take some now.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
Jim...?
Youíre probably right.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
What's going on?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Try it again.
I always check the batteries.
The Shawfish?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
I have no money!
Where you been?
What?
Yes.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
Where's Ma?
Bed.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
Here.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You're my father.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Bus hit him.
Fast.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
A bride without a head!
I can't believe what is happening.
I was dead.
What? What have we done?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
What's the matter?
He didn't come!
Loretta?
What!
I got things to do.
No?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
And we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
Did he tell her?
What the hell happened to you?
No. Are you drunk?
Where's pop?
Oh.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
You don't know where Loretta is?
May I presume to ask you a question?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
No.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I don't know.
She's got it.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Yes ...
What?
'Tis but a scratch.
You're a liar.
Come on then.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Stop that.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
A G...g...g...
What?
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Yes.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Good idea, O Lord!
... Well, we did do the nose.
The nose?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
That's easy!
I can't.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Farewell, Concorde!
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
How?
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Where are you going?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Oh ... hello ...
Well, she's got a point.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
No, no, no.
Not bad, not bad.
Sixty.
You know what I mean.
Aye, but will they?
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
It's a diary.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
I wish to see my mother.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Whom you address.
We --
I'm sorry?
You'll be sent a message.
Do you hunt?
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
I'm not married.
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
So...?
Aye, ma'am.
And the pony?
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
What?
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
That doesn't make him an expert.
What is it, John?  John?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
Yes.
Cold is good!
What is he doing there?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
From whom?
Then why are you not with him?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Dead?
Sick?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
I came from the city on the left.
It's twelve-thirty!
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Then leave her.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Then where do we go?!
You mean we learn the rules...
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
Dante's Inferno.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
One.  In case...
What the fuck is that?!
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
So start at the beginning...
No.
But I'm not broke.
Cynthia...what's going on?
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
One.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
No, I don't.
My name is Rita.
Hi.
No.
Good luck!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
No... but...
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
Yeah, they showed me
Find out who they are?
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Not a coke or anything?
Where are we ?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
Now where do we go ?
What are you doing ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Is this really the time ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I don't get it.
What about you ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
An elevator ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Trust is earned not given away.
Fire the whole division.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
One moment dear... 
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Then what do you want ?
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
What is Bruce doing ?
What was that ?
How can this happen ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
What an incredible view !
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
I think we should follow him...
Don't mention it.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Visualize a spare?
Well you know what I mean.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
No nuns, got it.
Yeah.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Thanks.
Sure am, who are you?
I told you it was a long story.
Special effects?
Come on in!
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Hi.
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Hi there...can I help you?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Thanks....
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Vada.
What if you don't wanna be found?
I think it's cool.
You would.
Boy, you're really into this.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Hey look!
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Yeah?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
For the mini-bike fund.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
Oh...what's that?
Hi!
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
You know how I feel about you.
Not exactly.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Beidermeyer?
Do you know him?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
You are perfectly healthy.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
It's no big deal.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
No, why?
Did she ever see Vada?
I haven't danced in.....
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Goodnight Vada.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He's okay isn't he?
Did I kill my mother?
In the garage.
Do you miss her?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
I'm very nervous.
Why?
No, no no....
What do you get for that?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Does he love her?
Do you like her?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Uh huh.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Goodnight.
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Oh great!
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Hey, where does it say that?
What do you want it for anyway?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I dunno..
Like this?
Just do it.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Kindred spirits.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
I can see why.
You like her.
I was devastated.
Go figure you.
And you believe that.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Excuse me?
How about...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Jesus, we're trapped!
Exactly.
I saw the show.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
W...
Quite the little eccentric.
Waiter! Check, please!
Should I whistle down a cab?
You miss her, huh?
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Will she like it?
I'm up against a deadline.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
This is her family and her fault.
Well.  How come she didn't...
The Big Hurt, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I hate that music.
Hi! Star.
Is there food?
You have to what?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
His Word.
You're kidding.
Hey!
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Mr. Green?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
You in music?
Parts.
Nashville.
Do you like him?
I'd really like to see you.
Oh.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Oh.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yes.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Sorry I'm late.
You're not.
We just got a gold record.
Come on.
Why?
What do you think of him?
You go to school together?
No, we never did that
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You want a ride into town?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
More or less.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Which do you recommend?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Hasn't it?
Divine intervention.
Looked like an interview to me.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Yes.
Manson beat you.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
And a snake-eye glare.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Roger, no.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Yeah, sure.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
But you'll never be whole again.
Really?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
They done that too long in my family.
Out.
Want me to come?
It sure is.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
What d'you want?
Okay.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
'Been up north?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Just for the day?
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Four.
What about that girl?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
I don't want to hurt you.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
See you, Duff.
Who're you?
Take it easy, Pop.
Want me to hold the light for you?
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Come back some other time, will you?
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Hello.
I guess I ain't.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Oh yeah?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Hi.
Come on, Will.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
He's your son.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
Can you take me to it?
How's the ice break?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What about the route to the core?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Case... are you okay?
And we really do have to talk.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Case...
I'll get the car.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I'll be okay.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Who?
Thanks.
Petty good.
What is with this school and prom?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What's that?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Jos, that's not what we're --
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
You need my help?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
A--flack jacket.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
I-
You like her?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Sure, why?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Do you think you'll find her?
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Yes.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
He <u>has</u> to know...
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Not at all!
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
No.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
You two got a thing going, or what?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
So, you feeling anything?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Jesse, God - what happened?
So, school going alright?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Wait and see.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
You got five minutes.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Crossed over?
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
This is nice.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Stop blaming yourself.
For what?
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Nancy...
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
How do we get in?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
What did you think?
That's enough, Kincaid.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Hi.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Films mainly.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Coffee?
Really, no.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Too complicated.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
She left me.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
You've got to go.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Eleven.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Yes.  Always have had.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Wow.
Who was Gilda?
That's not true.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Bella -- this is Anna.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Well, thanks, that's great.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
So I get the brownie?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
No -- you're right.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
And yet you suspect her.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Yes, Billy?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Get up, Billy.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Yeah, Mack?
They must be up there!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
A pecking party?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Giving up?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Just wait till you hear...
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Jesus God...
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
I see.
In what way?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
That's correct, Doc ...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
You bet, Doc!
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay!
I'm the next one.
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Yeah...
P.A. What the hell is that?
Hit me!
On what?
There they are!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Huh?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
You ol' fucker!
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Excuse me?
So, what's the story with your friend?
What?...
You're sure...
Good.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
Yes.  We did.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
I'm a liberal!
Dwayne?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Where are you going?
NO.
Yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
So?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
Hi, Peter.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Hey--
Any night.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Faith, this is my mother.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
Live happily ever after.
Are you sure?
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Your brother?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It was a ouija board, remember?
No.  No, you go ahead.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Yeah--
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Working hard?
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
None of your business.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
I'd better go in.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Were you really a prize fighter?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
And if you don't?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
He's going to have to grow up too.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Good luck.
I want to see you, Terry.
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
I'm so frightened.
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
A situation easily remedied.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Ahh, there is yet time.
There are others.
No. No! No!
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Lie face down on the floor.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
Why not?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Nice disguise.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
You ever wear one of these?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
It was an unusual experience.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
I have to qualify, is that it?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Leave it where it is.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
That's funny.
You don't seem all that scared.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Peter Finch.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Who was it answered the phone?
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
And your gun.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
What, as a sales rep?
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Weren't you expecting us?
When?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
The fish?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
You don't remember me, do you?
But you're sure we've met, huh?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
What's going on, Glenn?
Why's that?
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
No thanks.
What'd I say?
Was it Foley?
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He waved to you?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
It's possible.  Why?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Do you always stutter?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
You're Walker, right?
Yes Sir.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Then why are you looking for her?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
How come you're not pukin'?
You hear my okay?
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
I can't make it.
So beautiful!
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
I heard what you did.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
What else can we do?
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
What if the Japanese did invade?
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
Do you believe in all of that?
Let's go.
Carol!
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Where is it?
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Just what you underlined.
What's the matter?
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Why wait?
Would you?
Thanks.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
But what has to be different?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
What're you doing here?
That's real big of you.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Hello, Charlie.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
What are you shooting for?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Hi, Dad.
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
This morning was good.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Mom!
I'm excused.
What happened to you?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Why not? They're my favorite.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
What a great kite.
I	know what a burrito is.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
What's the matter?
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
I hear you moved into town.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Yes... why?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Mom...
Thanks, you guys.
Why are you getting dressed?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I'm ready...
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Kids are great.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Continue.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
What do you want?
Sure. It's fine.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
Except... you were gay?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Leave that.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
What kind of people?
Lots.
Duh...
Probably since she was born.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
You taught him a lesson.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Bottle-count.
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Why, what'd you hear?
Had it with deals.
What about her?
How many you see?
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Just come with me!
What do my eyes see?
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Hey, who?
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
For your own fear.
We're just burnin' light here.
Just shut up, okay?
We cannot go through there....
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
One is all?
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
New Mecca....
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Well, what's it look like now?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Not a star-jumper.
How did you know we'd come here?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
As you wish.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Look -- she remembers.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Geiger counter?
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What happened?
Landon! Join the expedition.
We got off at the wrong stop.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
He wouldn't leave her.
What is that?
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Sure.	In a cage.
Listen-
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Where's Lerner?
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
And you, do you believe?
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Right...
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I haven't been invited.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Okay. You win.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I see.
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Bad?
Bad enough.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Why not?
All right--following me.
Why?
Nothing matters.
So have I.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
This must have cost a fortune.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Well?
Wonder what?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
FLorida?
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You understand perfectly.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
I can't answer that.
Sometimes.
What are your rates?
Martini.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Round of golf Saturday?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
What do you want?
Passkey?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
It does.  May I go now? 
I'm interested in who handled it.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Not too far, I hope.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
Why should I mind?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
It's kind of you to see me.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
Yes.
Shall we go?
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Thank you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
...break away completely from--
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
In radio we're different.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
What about the Cromwells?
I'm not here.
Dad.
No.
Darling Susan.
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
We'll see what we can do.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Ah, Susy, it...
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
How you figure?
One shot stopping.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
You gonna pull?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
The hell are they?!
People are expendable to Bodhi.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Bye.
We're going to need everyone.
That's over the border, General.
There's something else, Major...
What in God's name...?
Your uncle will like this.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
That's ridiculous.
Sit... and spin.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
What do you like?
I sell them.
Vivian --
What?
It'd cost you.
I got a dress, yeah.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
I think you'll approve.
Why not?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
What did you do to him?
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
You're being ridiculous.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes?
Then why bother curing me?
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
I killed him myself.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I fear I'll never see you again.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
I don't think more than ten.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Yellin.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Hah?
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
How old were you?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
You've made your decision then7
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
What is that?  A handkerchief?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Max, I...
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Yes.
Not.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Do it!  Do it!
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Of Siegfried...
Heil you know who!
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Vat?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
No! Of all...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
She isn't still here, is she?
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
Five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She stole some money.
A lot?
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
With the forty thousand dollars?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
She haven't even called you?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
She'll need both of us.
Where's the old highway?
Yes.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
He didn't come back here?
In a hurry.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Where'd you go to college?
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I'd like to.
What are you running away from?
Is there?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
I'll get your bags.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
No mother.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Take me down there.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
You're losing your blood?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I don't agree with you.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
Why didn't you eat last night?
I won't let you say that!
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
What!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
What do you mean?
No kiddin'?
I told you he was a sore.
Fine, thanks.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
That happens to be the truth.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
You go in for dangerous things.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
What is it? What happened?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Shall we unpack it?
What are you laughing at?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
What?
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Yes?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Nobody.
But who were they?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Actually, I am, though.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
She's watching the car again?
This is my place and you can't have it.
She's putting the titty back.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
A wonderful woman, boy.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
How goes it, darlin'?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
It's twenty after one.
Who?
Yes, sir.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
No, sir.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Well, it was a silly question.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
I... I can explain...
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
What... ?
How's your precious little school-marm today?
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
Where we going?
Gimmie a butt.
You don't smoke.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
No, we're stealing.
Can't you say something nice once?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
No.
You could start over again with cash like that.
Maybe.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
You know... you could say thank you.
Slow down.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
You need a doctor.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Do tell.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
But I have no sister.
Jabba's palace.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Are you all right?
Wouldn't miss it.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Here we go again.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
What's he saying?
He's my father.
I know, father.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Told you, did he?
Well, I'm sorry.
You!
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
Yes Brad.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I'm coming with you.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Maybe we could try it this way.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Like I'm outside in the rain
Oh no no no no.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Yes, I do.
I always knew you was pretty.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Apollo?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
I can't go out.
Oh, Rocky!
...Paulie. Stop now!
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Seven minutes!
Six!
That's ten bucks.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
No action.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Why?
I won't.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
How do you mean?
What's happened is freak luck.
How 'bout a glass of water?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Damn! How's it look?
Wanna keep goin'?
Would you keep goin'?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
Hey --
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
...Maybe I better forget it.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Help what?
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
Whatta these guys want?
Do you feel you have a chance?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
So you're Cloverleaf?
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Toon cops worked me over.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I didn't know who I could trust.
How did you get onto Doom?
What a gasser.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
I've already seen your photographs.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Aah!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Does this help?
How do you know that?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Wrong number?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I think you oughta read it to her.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Why, what is Tybalt?
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
'Tis he.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Hold Daughter!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
I have.
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Amen
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Ay me!
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Ahhh!
Well what shall I swear by?
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
This is important.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Well I don't!
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
Who the fuck are you?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Nobody's saying they don't.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
He's company.
There's been a slight problem.
I take it you still want the money...
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Whoever hired us.
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
So what do we do?
A means to an end, is that it?
American.
Created?
You shoot alright.
Long enough to shoot back.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
The question still remains: what do we do now?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
I'm going with you.
Clearly.
It's my job.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Gone.  Destroyed.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
What the hell...
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He would have done it to us, right?
You said that last time!
You're crazy.
How long is it going to take?!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Do you have everything?
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Well, I don't know...
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
What's wrong?
OK.  I love you.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
You're worth every last penny.
Great...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
What did he buy?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
I don't know.
What do you think about all this?
What are you getting at?
Dwayne.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Anything...specific?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Whatever...
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I was in the neighborhood.
At least around here it does.
This whole place?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Winner!  Four, winner!
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Carter, get off that stage!
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
Who?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
How do you know he's our man?
She's getting undressed.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Wait!  There's people down there!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Shhh, my head hurts.
Why did you help me?
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
What is this?
This money is evidence.
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
I could use a little vacation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Baby Duck?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You know what a phone booth is?!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
You speak English!
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
Are you OK?
Oh no, I dropped it.
Oh my god. Griffin.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Jesus...what do you want?
At this point we don't have much.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
She's fine.
Han?
I am so sorry about your men.
I was trying to find the right time.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
See you at the wedding.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Rub your ears.
Or a vegetarian?
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I don't think that's why she ran.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
That's fair.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Too much.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Yes.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
What!?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Well, you do have the dress.
Does it matter?
You were not.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
Ya think?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm going to kill myself.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
You okay?  I'm closing.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
What?
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
You know.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Hello.
Which means --
All righ...
It's been about a year and a half.
It's not that late in Seattle.
Where's your mom?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Dad, could you close the door?
What?!
Like do you believe in heaven?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
This is a good letter, Dad.
Not now, Jonah --
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
God, she's beautiful.
Are you going with her?
You said we could go to New York.
I can't believe you flew first class.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Whose side are you on anyway?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
No, Estellita.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
This water's cold again.
Over my dead body.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
A meeting?
Be still ...
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Go on. Spill it.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Ride 'em cowboy)
Why don't you call the cops?
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How much time do you have?
What are you hiding, Danny?
Why not?
Really, I don't want to.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Twelve
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
What?
Fuuuuuck
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
I think on account of his nose.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
Crank or glass?
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
No last name?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
This chink have a name?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Jesus.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
That would be me.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
When is the deal going down?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Tom, quit fucking around.
What do you mean?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Report.
Resistance?
Sir?
A private, sir?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
Where?
Not yet.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Good luck, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
But, sir...
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
You alright?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Yeah, how so?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Don't do that again.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Pardon me?
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Then what's love?
I don't feel anything.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I can put that together.
You like it?
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I'm sorry.
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Hi.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
I'll go.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
You know what?
What?
Then call me tomorrow.
Yeah.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
I don't think I am.
What's wrong?
No.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.
Okay.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Thanks Lloyd.
No, really.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
So what's up?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Later for you, Luke.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Sir, the list is correct.
All right, okay, let's talk.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
I just told you.
God bless you, sir.
Good.  How's it going?
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We know that, son.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
How's the name search going?
Have you checked the...
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
I'm inquisitive.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You could start with an apology.
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
No, I don't.
What's your subject?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
He seemed harmless.
Need some help, honey.
I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
Hello, Dwight.
Yeah?
Not good. How you doin?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Let's go.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Don't do this.
Knock yourself out.
Time to change numbers again?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Who is that guy?
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..it's really about family and tradition...
Hello?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
More of a game really.
What?!
Yeah.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Yeah?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Jennifer needs me.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Your life?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Let's get out of here!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Hello.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
W-what do you want?
Are you sure?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
What are you doing here?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Who did you call?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't think so.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Please don't hurt him.
That all depends on you.
No...
I don't know...
What's his name?
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Deputy... good evening.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Does mom know?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
You girls ready.
Afraid not.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
She staying with you?
That fish smelled strong.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
And why would she do that?
So where are you?
Uh-huh.
No you didn't.
Have a good trip.
Working, thank you.
Stop. Right there.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's past seven.
Shit, what is he doing here?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
For once, Stu, drop it.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
It's none of my business anymore.
Spit it out.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Here he comes.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
It's too soon for him.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Punishing.
Nothing.
I know.
Does this make it with you?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
What is it?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Tell me it's not true.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
It smells good.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
I say NO!
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Ellen, move aside...
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
You?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Maybe an animal.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Mrs. Straub!
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Oh
Ah
Follow that boat!
Yes.
Do you know that house?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
That's me.
How?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are lost.
Kit
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"Ay me."
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Can you love a fool?
Moonlight!
There is time. It is still dark.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
My lady Viola.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Is there a man?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Only on expenses.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Doesn't it worry you?
They know.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Cover it?
Is this being recorded?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
The man we know and love.
Have you seen Hugo?
Yes.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
I thought we all were.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Stop nagging.
No, no, it's different.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Where he can't get it?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Interesting.
So, uh...
You mean I can have the room?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
Two hundred.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
What do we do here, David?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy?
That one, last week.
It's nice.
I see.
No.
Do you think you could answer that?
You know about it?
The first one was fine.
Same as everyone else.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- is that right?
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
She's got a...
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I'll be back in a while.
What kind of treatment?
I can see that.
-- Anyway.
Oh, no.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Are you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
What?
Yeah.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
That you're just like your mother.
How is she?
Right, that's right.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Buffums?
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Probably the bathroom.
You don't seem very sure.
Great.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
You know what I'm talking about.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- we can't now.
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- good afternoon --
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
What?
Yeah!
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
There were some shots.
Here in the canyon.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
Fine. How are you?
What?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
You've never even been around one.
George?
Okay, baby. Okay...
Could I talk to you for a second?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
I know, honey.
-- go ahead.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Well that's something.
What difference does it make?
How?
-- yes.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
But Mr. Norman said --
It's good you want to do something, George.
... this doing hair it's...
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
-- yeah?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
You live like a pig.
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Have a drink.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
No --
I'll call you back.
What do you mean?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Steve?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
That's right.
I'll call you.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
We don't think marriage is important.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- uhh-huhh...
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Where to, Les?
Yes, Dad.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Jack...
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Red Rum.
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
How did he manage to do that?
Advocaat is it?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Grady?
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
I'm a Wendy.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Pleased to meet you.
No charge?
Sure is.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes.
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Go away.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I don't believe they did.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Can I tell you kids something?
Sure, Uncle Al.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Huh?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
A tracer. You'll like it.
You want to know what I think?
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Really.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
What? 
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Yes, Betty?
Oh-huh.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
That machine.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Pay attention...
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Van Cartier.
She won't?  Why not?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Who are all these people?
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Goddamn it!
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
But -- why?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Oh?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I've got to go.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Where's who?
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
Right.
I can't see anything in here!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
She's gettin' away!
Neither did you!
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Not a note.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
She's a nun, Vince.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Excuse me?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
It is sacrilege!
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
How could he?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
What now?  Where is she?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Other people?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
What?
I apologize if I worried you.
What are you doing?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
No.  She has gone out.
Where?
You... you are alive.
Go home.
She is guilty.
I can't remember.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
Childers.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
They still around, your folks?
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Yeah, I did.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Where'd you get them flowers?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Oh, jackin' off?
I don't reckon I know.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Yeah.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
I reckon.
Yes sir.
You scared me.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Yes sir.
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He just got out of the state hospital.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Yes sir.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Signs?
What!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
What happened?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
I'd love to.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
What do you mean?
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Ready. Any time you are.
Yeah, probably.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
No you're not.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I almost got married once.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
A little. Not much.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
And why the hell would you give me money?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Huh?
I owe you something.
Well, if you put it that way...
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Here and there. Around.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I didn't expect to see you again.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
He's dead?
Two or three nights.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Thanks. 
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
That's it. In a nutshell.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
I don't know.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Well, why does it?
Maybe...?
Cigarette?
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
For certain, no.
Can I say something, here?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Get lost, will you?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
What did he say?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
I thought you weren't talking to me.
You've flipped your wig!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Done what?
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Men?
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Oh, he does!
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Have I got things to tell you!
WHAT?
Oh.
That's some nerve!
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
We better have a drink first.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
Yeah - Josephine.
I guess she's not in here.
I hope so.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Me too.  Bye now.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
Goodbye?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
No - funerals.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Which one is yours - the big one?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
You collect shells?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Josephine.
One of whom?
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Where's your shell collection?
Harmless - how?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
You poor, poor boy.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
I never knew it could be like this.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
What's the matter, Sugar?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
I know.  Every time!
Booze.
We got different information.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Hey.
It was such a long time ago.
You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
She did?
I had to say something to get you here.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
So, what’s your point?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
I’m sorry?
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Who are they?
Would you grab my shampoo?
What?!
Are you sure?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Yeah.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
Sunday...
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Did you see Daddy?
Poor creature...
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Hello, David...
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
Good mornin', Nathan.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
My head hurts.
Montana.
Pillow.
Why the fuck not?
Fuckin' a right.
To free Terrance and Phillip.
What is this?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
What Cartman?!
Oh yeah.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Aw, ma!!
MOM!!!
Uhh... I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
And Bill?
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
You don't care.
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
You didn't?
Check.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
I think I can handle it.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
We don't.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
You're ready for the real thing?
Yeah?
Do you want some advice?
Sure.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
What?  What are you talking about?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
I'm homesick.
Well now what are we gonna do!
What the hell is that?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
I never saw you.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Uh...over easy.
It depends.
Knock-knock.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What ever happened to just bowling?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
I like the sport the way it is.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
I'm a bowler.
Where can I find him?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
I could let them go for ten.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
I feel sick.
Are you sure he's dead?
Fuck plan C!
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm not here to bowl.
Some unfinished business.
Who identified the body?
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
They told me about sixty hours.
Nice work, Captain sir.
High Voltage?
But you've tested it?
That's our reserve air.
Captain.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Storm?  What storm?
A thousand feet.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Picked up something?  What is it?
What do you mean, he's missing?
How drastic?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
-- and then brought her down here --
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
She's not gonna know.
What is that?
Wait -- down where?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Wait a minute.
You went through Edmunds' things?
What?
Why should I go?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Manifested?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Ulcers.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Bingo.
Riordan?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
I'll just boost the doses.
Beth --
You ever given an injection before.
What is it, Norman?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
It's getting cold.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
You manifested that, Beth.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
But I have to, Norman.
Stop it!
Beth?
What is that?  What are you doing?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Well, what's your theory?
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
You're staring at me.
How are you feeling, Norman?
You sound defensive.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Did I kill her?
We're never gonna make it.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
You know how to work this thing?
Well, press something!
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
The ships?
The others, sir?
What was that, sir?
You mean a picture?
Squint harder.
You seen my suitcase?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
What do I do?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Have you been checked out?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Here come six more... grid two!
Who's the pilot?
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
Well, I practice a lot...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Watch it!  Move back.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
No need, everything's under control.
No!...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Your father will never let you.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
I'm sorry, Carmen.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Why not ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
What ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
It stinks, you goin.
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Mr. Rasczak.
I won't quit !
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
It's taken control of the computer...!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
What should you have known?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Then you'll be wet.
I have one, but they lost it.
Well, it had sentimental value.
I quit.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
It's about life.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Yes...
But, but but but...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
And likewise.
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
...lost the screw...
"Room Service!"
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Later on.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
That's right...
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Good morning.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Lookit that, up already.
Carla was in the car, right?
After Drama Group.
Hi!
We had a date.
I'm sorry.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
They're holding it for ransom.
He's on the ph...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Waterford, Vermont.
I will.
...they run on water.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
What do you drink?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Aren't you ever in school?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Get him on the phone.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Who is that...?
Yes, yes, but...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Hello.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
I'll put the, in your r...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
How about that.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Town's out of lilacs.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I'm gonna nail it.
Then you're finished in show business.
Hi!
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
Marty...
It's just a formality.
<u>Find</u> it.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
...we can't lose the wind...
Mass hysteria.
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
And what do you do wh...
I don't want to say goodbye.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Hold lunch!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Not use my words, please!
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
No.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Our children.
It's a huge moment in their life --
It's temporary.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Get out!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
However many.  It's not enough.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
We have to talk.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Rache, get out of th...
She's not gonna die.
Well, they will be.
I told her I loved her.
There are some rumors...
I'll be your guest!
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
My baby.
But still, you can't be sure.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Sure!...
Was anyone in my room today?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Huh?
You mean, again?
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Fuck!
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Uh huh.
That's good.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
Hello?
Oh, fine. How are you?
So what's going on?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
I know.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Well Cooper...
Are the labs in operation?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
How goes the roll call?
Agreed--let's move it.
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
What does that mean?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
What is your name, young lady?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
General Schmuck?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Yes, sir.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
What's the target.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
They can't touch us at this height.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Shoot, Lothar.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Yes, Major.
What do you mean?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Who's that?
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Can I have some?
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Responsibility, progress.
Oh.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Now?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
And your mom.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
That sounds so depressing.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Thanks. See man?
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Yeah!
Yes!
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Oh, sure.
It's coming along.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
That chick, Erica?
Wow. You did that for me?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
What?
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
About things that are important to me.
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
Okay, what would you have done.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Mm-hm.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Yeah.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Jesus, Jeff.
No, I'm going.
Me?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Could you give me a ride?
Cleo!
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
You sure?
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
That was gas, Sweetie.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
You want us to help you pick up?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Really...
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
I didn't.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
So do I.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Gordon Cole?
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I don't know.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
What scene?
Cut away from me?
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
What's wrong with It?
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
You think this is all very funny.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
When did he say it, Norma?
How did it go?
Good night.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Yes, I am, Norma.
Wanted what?
Is that so!
What doctor?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
How is she?
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Paramount studios.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What does it mean?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
At last. Ultimate Power.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Don't leave me.
When can I see, you again ?
Let's talk about us, not her.
But why?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
Miss what?
I don't see why not.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
They think I have a concussion.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Guess! Go on.
Theories?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Where is Earth?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Why is he acting so strangely?
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
That was meant for me!
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
What are you talkin' about?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
You look wonderful.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
I didn't --
You...um...you never got married?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Uh-huh.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
What are you doing?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
The boss wants to see you.
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Man, what is this?
Columbia.
Just the man I wanted to see!
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
They ain't got captains?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
I didn't have my camera with me.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Ricky?  Where...what...
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
We've already met.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
How would you know?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
53.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
85,000 dollars.
Missing????
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
We already have a super-tanker.
What's wrong?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Jimmy, how's the -
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Uh. . .
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Really?
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
I want to.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
You're not selfish at all.
What else could I do?
Lois, someday --
I'll try to remember that . . .
What??
Good. My heart can't take it.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Superman! The --
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
I'm sorry to see you go.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Like me?
Awesome!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Where's Clark?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
But why the hair?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
I'll deal with you later.
I'd like to.
Your bookie?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Huh?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Jealous? Of what?
Listen...thank you.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Bet he makes it.
No news is not good news. Y'know
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
With my luck, now it'll rain.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Well...flashlight?
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I guess they are a little odd.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
It's not bad.
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
It is for me.
Of time, Luthor.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
What happened?
My name is...
I understand.
It does concern me.
Because it's what we have to do.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
A while.
Your kids never cry.
Sure.
Good night, Billy.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Yes.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
From what?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
That would complicate things.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
You seem very sure about that.
It was snowing.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
What about Doreen?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Dolores?
Any criminal record?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
What do you remember about the accident?
Of course.
What's that?
Pretty slick, eh?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Are you finished?
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
How?
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
I don't think so.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
I know you do, Sidney.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I didn't do anything!
I tried to reach you twice -
Do you know about the chip?
What chip?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
No.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Alriight!!  My man!
Drive faster.
I have to go away, John.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Steve.
Mine's the Eleventh.
No. Ours was damaged.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Why were they going to arrest you?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who?
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
I wish to say something.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Then you are wrong.
Von der Null?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I don't understand what you mean.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Yes, you remember.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
So, you never heard of him.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
First oboe.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Anything else?
You can't to that...
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
What do you think?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Reese...you got a first name?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
I volunteered.
You'll learn.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Hot dogs?
He'll find us, won't he?
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
Good fighters.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
What are you doing?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Call her.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
It was a gift... from my brother.
I'll give you a boost.
Never did catch your name.
A fresh shirt...
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Can we talk?
Where'd you get this?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
They're watching.
Who is it?
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
What the fuck are you... ?
Guess you missed it.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Julliard, yeah.
Underwear?
Happy Birthday, man.
They'll be wanting it back.
Call that number.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
This isn't an escort service?
But, will you?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
It's different every time.
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
Look, where is he?!
Anything wrong... ?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Well, I... uh...
Do we still get paid for the week?
You're not telling us something.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
I didn't do it.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
All right...
Hmm.
Welcome Home.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Why'd she kill herself?
She was unhappy.
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
Mrs. Dudley.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
I love this house.  I really love this house.
How could he have left without his keys?
David?
That's so sad.
I don't think I want any.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I'm not.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Why not?
What.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Yeah?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
This ain't your lot?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Has he?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
I see.
I bet.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
You don't seem bothered.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Five thousand.
Makin' trouble for someone?
She's nice lookin'.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
So why would he want to see you.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Who?
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
I don't understand.
That right.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
...You bring a check?
All right.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
...You know... who *who* is?
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
You don't have to--
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
No thanks.
Coffee, Ed?
Frank.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
What the--
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Uh... you're under arrest.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Forget it!
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
We need light in here, stat.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Dr. Green has to see you!
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Where is that?
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Stop!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
What?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of egg is it?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
And John?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Dr. Green...
They're all heavily armed.
Genetic damage?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
I think... it means it's full.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Help someone!
I don't believe it.
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
<i>Fiji.</i>
That's right.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
What's he doing?
The memory of who?
How can they have a child?
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
How about them?
What're we doing here, Truman?
Stay where you are!
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
What's that?
What's that?
It'd be an adventure.
Good night, Mother.
I won't be here Sunday.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You hate gambling.
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Not supposed to talk about it.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Special Agent Scully --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
This man's still alive.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Who?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What was it?
What killed those men?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
How can I reach you?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
I think they have that covered.
Mulder...?
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
And you've never seen anything like that?
All the equipment is brand new.
This virus -- it... 
This is weird, Mulder.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
What is it?
What do you mean, walked?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
A pocketful of rye...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
I did, yeah.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
I heard Julia and John got married.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
You're kidding me.
When did he lapse into the coma?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Dr. Kent.
So?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
You were awfully good.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
In German?
Holly.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Why are you lying?
...parents.
That's the reason.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
How will I know you?
What is it?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
What are you trying to say?
Miss Schmidt.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Fifty yards right down there.
Calloway!
Be sensible, Martins.
Yes.
Did the police believe you?
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
Why not?
...the best way one can, you know.
Could he have been at all conscious?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Baron Kurtz.
Could he have been conscious?
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
He didn't want to get involved.
...this time.
Passport, please.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Hi.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
I have a job.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
How would you kill him?
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
A poison...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Those aren't Jews.
Are all Jews the same?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
To hear them read Torah.
I can't help what I think.
It was a nine millimeter.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
How did you get the fucking number?
Steve...
Tell it to Hitler.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
How?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
So what?
We tested the new bomb.
Eat shit....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
What kind?
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Congratulations.
You forgot the Hula!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Well, good night, then...
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Because you'd laugh.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Where did you get that?
I don't have one.
Well, what are they?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
You say that because you have the title!
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I recognize you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Jacques, you set a world record.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
You'll try again tomorrow?
What's wrong?
You want to lie down for a while?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
Well?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
... And those?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Why is he doing this?
Will he understand Spanish?
Wait!  Professor...?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
So. Do you have a name?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
So don't show a picture.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
What's your shpiel, Santa?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
What did they say before the bad card came up?
See you tomorrow —-
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
State hunters?
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
On his back, I suppose.
Who was the other man?
Yeah.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
When will they be back?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
...You-you spoke to him?
You bastard...
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
...We’re turning in circles.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Something like that.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
By your Austrian?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What about an untrained pup, white...
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
Where is he?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
What?
B-Black...
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Must I speak to you in French?
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
What happens now?
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
What is?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
I’m sorry...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Could that be Camden Market?
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
They lost their son. Why?
Cost what?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
I would like some fresh straw.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Yes...
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
What... what do you mean?
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Sound the retreat...
Yes...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
And when was that?
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
In a village called Domremy.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
But... her army's so small now...
Get them out of here!
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Good.  Where are the English?
What's going on?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes.  We can pray.
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
My king.
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Hello.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Sit.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
For what? For my tie?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Tough luck.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Who's recruiting?
And suppose they take the table away?
It's not funny.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Wladek! How are you?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Bitch!
How long have you been here?
It's a little cut, nothing.
What about you?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
To be deaf?
The Alps.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
What for?
What did she say?
Oh no, it can't come now.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Naw, it's okay.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
How much did ya lose?
You think my play is bad?
If that's the way you want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
I like griftin'.
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
Hackers.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I picked something up on the way.
We'll get by without 'em.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
How'd ya do?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Looks like he's sulking.
Raise 1,000.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
My end was only one.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It isn't any better.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
How am I gonna do that?
You want a drink or something?
Don't think I know him.
I'll make parole.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Oh, Andy.
What are you talking about?
Dorothy!
Give it to me.
I didn't.
Mother!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Dead?
This is my wedding.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Shrapnel!
Not a thing.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
What do you mean?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Well....
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
What are you going to do?
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Did you get my money?
Is Julia going with you?
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
What are you going to do with it?
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
You're a fine watch dog.
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
You talk as if I were Asta.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You dog!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Well, don't they?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
I hope you're well.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Nick Charles here?
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Where were you going?
Wha...
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
You just go when I say go.
What am I supposed to do?
Epps!
Maybe I do.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
What about Jaeger?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Knock it off!
Blow me.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Now this is war.
Take the binoculars.
You can't tell anybody about this.
How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
Forget Wes.
No.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
An Iraqi?
To where?
What do we do?
Why haven't they killed us!?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
It doesn't mean anything.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
Oh, God!
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
So?
What do you think?
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
What's this?  Why did you change it?
Look, food!
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
It's 3+27 hundred
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
What?
They're watching us now.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
What's going on?
You're in violation.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Maternity ward, huhh!
What was that....
No......  She's dead THX........
Remember this...?
Yes.
May I help you?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
How's the print coming?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Where did you get this?
What're you talking about?
So what were they doing here?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
I terrible with mechanical things.
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
More metal... sharp edge...
Whadaya mean?
You got it.
Bev, you're the greatest...
No... No more killing.
You touch me again and--
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Look who's talking, old man.
You don't fish.
So what're we looking for?
Yes, sir.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
No!
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Niente!</u>
No.
Umm.
Smart. London, eh?
Just dull.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
And as for you, waiter--
Um-hum ...
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu ...
Gaston Monescu.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
What?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
M'sieu Laval!
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Yes.
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
You think that's too much?
Then riding together.
Precisely.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
I <u>believe</u> you.
You look beautiful.
Goodbye.
Yes--uh--
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Please!  Thank you.
About what?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
I beg your pardon!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Yes, my bag!
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
A hundred and one next month.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
What could possible be funny?
What do I tell your mother?
You're precious to me, Rose.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
How cold?
You're crazy.
You're welcome. Rose.
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
And...?
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Sure. If you like.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
What is it? A sapphire?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I promise.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Do you want the truth, Anya?
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Oh--a hundred times--
Will you leave me alone?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I'll say she is!
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Good-by!
There's soft music--
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Well, I can't.
Okay.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Who with?
What do you know about them?
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
We coulda got two third-class!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
What's that?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
What?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Who won?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
McKinney's the name.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Is this your gun?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you happy?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
What's the matter, Mary?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
--you'd go with him!
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
I don't understand.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Come and get him.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Excuse me?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
You retired, too?
Ecentus stultorum magister.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
So what does he want?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
You'd die for fun?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Mattie.  What about this?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
What'd you do that for?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
How you doin', boy?
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Yes -
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
It must do something.
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
... Shoelaces?
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
No.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Why don't we just take these -
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
You won't get away with this!
How sweet.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
You all act like two roosters.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Man, act like this is your home.
Good morning.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You invited me.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow!  Cool!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Right here in the van.
Woody!  Buzz!
Which one can I open first?
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Can!
That's why.  Sid.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Woody, stop it!!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
What?!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Hi!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
What?
I dunno.
What?
She's sick!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
I'm red this time.
Woody?!
He's a pyjama case, really.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I want to go home.
Finn ...
I already lost everything once.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Did you do this?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Don't bother.
What?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
What's up?
You all right?
How's David?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Do you work?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
She ain't in on it.
Are you getting this on tape?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
You first.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Yeah.
A group of us are going out tonight.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
My work keeps me young.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Like you protected Landry?
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Who do we interface with on their side?
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
I'll be right after you.
Can you not go yourself.
I'd fucking kill you.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Diane.
It's where I live.
Is that a promise, then?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It's Iggy Pop.
Unless you get caught.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
But try too hard --
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Director?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
What about The Untouchables?
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Cut it out.
Why?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
But you don't have the money?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
The Sick Boy method.
No, I don't think so.
Stick it on my tab.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Where did she come up with that?
Well, what are you waiting for?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
It could. Yes.
No, no, it's not possible.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
What's going on?
Join my quest.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
Oh, God
Life is not a dream.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I have a half brother.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
How do you know?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
No... I didn't.
Your vision?

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Sybok, we must find a way...
You did break in.
Hi, Alan.
Okay, okay...
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Way to go! We're haulin'!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Where did you hear that name?
What's that?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
We have to talk.
Yes, MCP.
What do you think?
How?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Yeah, Dad.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
You're kidding.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Helen's going to be pissed.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
What are you talking about?
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
So, it was your first time.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
17 years.
I don't take those assignments.
What?
What are you going to do?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Beat it.
Boris and Doris?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
What's going on, Harry?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
To our assignment.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Did you get the letter?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Thanks a lot.
How 'bout me what?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
Do you get paid a lot?
What's that?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I don't believe so.
Write down Drexl's address.
You don't know him -
How come?
What?
Clarence?
Tomorrow.
I know.
Is he big league?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
I'd fuck Elvis.
What are we gonna see?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Yeah?
Say it, goddamn it!
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Wanna count your money?
I'm really not very -
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Where'd he come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Do you believe him?
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You do.
We gotta get him outta there.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
No way, JosÈ.
No.
Him?  You saw that man?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
Meaning...???
So that...???
Do you know why you're here, James.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
A jail?  Prison?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
This is April, right?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It's just a shot to calm you.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
They're keeping an eye on me.
James, why don't we...?
What's the matter with your leg?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Uh, that message...me?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
What...virus?
No, thank you.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Will he be back soon?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You son of a bitch!
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I want my car.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
You got beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
Wrong number.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess it must.
Those are white words, not ours.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Where?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
John?  John where are you going?
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Where's the safe?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
Now what?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I think I busted my leg.
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Would I what?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I was hoping we could talk.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
What should I do?
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
You didn't kill her?
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
That's a thick change of heart.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
For what?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Kids.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
I don't understand what the--
Soda.  You got any soda?
No police.
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Accident.
Like you don't know.
I do.
You're talking like a madman.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Come on, Jake --
What happened to your hand?
Got any requests?
So?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Great!
Twenty-after-ten.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Hundred-fifty.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Soda.  You got any soda?
You sure you can manage?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
What do you do anyway?
I don't know how.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace ... Grace?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Why's that?
Harlin's.
"Arkady"
Which you don't have.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I've come to a decision.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
I'm not sure.
Think carefully?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
Quick.
I'm going to go in.
No.
No.
How much did you take off?
How much is it?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Where were you sitting on the train?
Against a window.
Why?
Where is it?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Rain's coming.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Nope.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Duke.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Huh?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Is it him?
Yeah, I guess so.
Lemmee see it.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
You're marking us, Bill.
He's dead, Bill.
What is it, son?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Fuck you.
Yeah.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Just like that?
What was the money for?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Come home, Dean.
That's enough, Edie.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
This is not right.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
You are a criminal.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Keaton, I can't just -
Ready?
with what?
Who's your boss?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
So this lawyer...
Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
Because he was my friend.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
I'm fine.
Nothing.
We thought it was just.
And no one will know the truth.
It looks that way.
...I was one of a group of...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Neurology?
I am seventy-four years old.
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
I do.  Yes.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
Ready, your Honor.
Listen to me, fella...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Mr. Alito, please.
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Dr. Gruber's not in.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
I have to talk to you.
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Kathy Price...
Yes...
Yes.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
I -- I --
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
You won't have to.
Your name. And --
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Will you have dinner with me?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
They're none of them right.
Judy --
You can.
Where are you going?
No! Let me go!
Some money.
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
Wander about.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Long ago...
Take me away from here?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
What do you remember?
Where?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
No... we're together...
Madeleine --
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
I've never run across one like that.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
That's following a train of thought.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Is she pretty?
Just wander.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Yes! That's it!
Well...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
You're an asshole Adam.
The hell you do.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
More.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Are you sure this was an accident?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
I'm calling the police.
Her fucking head was caved in.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What about the blood?
Wait. Wait a minute.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
What is your problem?
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Where's the candy?
If anything ever happens to me...
I don't think so.
Have you thought about what I said?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
She's not here.
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
But not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
We need padded chairs.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
What?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Take care of business.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
False.
Not true.
What's your point?
What?
Ball park sausages.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Stop.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Yes.
Why did you forget the tent check?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Who else?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's quiet.
You expect more what?
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Do you love me?
So what do we do?
I'll call them from the road.
Hello.
Not yet.
Nesting?
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
What kind of stupid question is that?
But...
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
So what do we do?
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I don't care for him.
Go for it.
I don't hear it.
No...No.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Where's Boyd?
Fucking desert.
Shut up Micheal.
I'll come to you tonight.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
He was asking for it.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Why the bad temper?
So, Ramona!
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
And ...your friend?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Stop this!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
There's been an accident.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Don't talk like that!
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Today, a good girl.
What?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not from in here.
Enough to level an entire city block.
This better not be a wild goose chase.
What the hell happened?
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
I haven't been working on anything.
You catching my drift?
SID —— NO!!!
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
What does that mean?
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
What about it?
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
It won't hold.
<u>Do</u> it...
What is it?
...the... 
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Why is this putz on the air...
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
...this's <u>good</u>...
Our adopted land...
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
...brazen-it-through...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
What are we going to do?
Pride of a job-well-done...
Wilfred.
What about him?
Stanley, you can't do this....
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
I have.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
When's he coming back...?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
Yeah...?
...this the Guy.
Mmm...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
An anti-psychotic...
...but...
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
I didn't ask for a dog.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
Just want to take a nap.
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Oh, hell...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Another cup of coffee?
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...I can't even see it...
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
I gather you're a decorator.
Well, why stop at that?
I don't.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Hi.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Businessman!
But?
What's that?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Would you like a closer look?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Anyone else not coming?
Well divide 18 into three
Sell my soul?
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
Did you?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I'm sorry?
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
She never mentioned her father.
They're calling me in to work.
What was her major?
Wow.
I didn't sleep with him.
How you holding up?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Jody--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Oh God...you knew.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
Like what?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire?
Fine.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's just us now.
After that.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Oh.
Claire?
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Get down!  He'll see.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
I didn't do that.
...Don't get all...
There we go.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
...Please stop...
What's the matter?
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
I never asked you to quit!
You should have tried harder.
Adamant.
Don't think so.
What's that for?
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
Rowan...
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
Just one.  The bar's closed.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
you're very --- different.
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Hello...?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Stop it!
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
So there is only one key...
This must be one of the old keys -
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
STEPHANIE?
What is it?
It's been what, three years?
At home alone - where were you?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Check this out.  Hurry!
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
I thought I loved her.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
So that's a maybe?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Well, why should I?
Yeah.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Who exactly ARE you?
Ted! Do something!
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
You're on the next plane home.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
That's a crappy thing to say.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Me?
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I see.
I want you to trust me.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Like what?
But who would run the store?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Try, Kelly.
Maybe she used another name.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
That bothers you?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
You are.
Okay, what's the matter?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
Why can't you come...
You know what it takes.
Hello.
I'm running away.
But check this...
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Yeah, right.
We?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sandy... What's up?
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
You need that real often?
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
That's a lot of butler.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
You feeling all right?
Now, what was that?
All that jumping and kicking.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
At least I tried something.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Oh, thank you.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Anyone?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Really?
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
You've... done... this... before.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Are you all right?
I beg your pardon?
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You managed alright.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Why did you say that?
Say what?
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Why.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Did she ask about me?
She's a bird, Willow.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Kill him!
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
But what am I gonna transform??
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Milking?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Your hole is healed, then?
Everything is all right, John.
Is it them?
Who else knows?
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
It's all over, Paul.
Where are you taking us?
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Home.
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Who are they?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
What else can you do?
I got there late, John.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You admit you're lying?
I admit I don't know where he is.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
He's not in this building.
He'll live.
I don't want to stay here.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
From now on you'll be history
Our echo.
...resourceful!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Uh-huh.
Did you say something?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
A home --
I'd sooner wait outside.
Because I'm still scared!
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
They're coming back!
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Um-hmm.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Ah --
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- Oh --
Not even a rhinoceros?
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Where do we go now?
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Let's.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
No, you don't.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Well --
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Who is it?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
I can’t stay here.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
He used your exact words.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Where did you get this?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Mother of God.
The Maiden’s Tower.
What?
What class sub does your nephew run?
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
This is the end.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Hi, Jon.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
I'm here, Laurie.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
I won't do that.
Jon --
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Laurie --
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Yes you are.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Coward.  Giving up.
I can fix it.
I don't know their real names.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Am I free to go?
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Why is that?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Yes it does.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
You do everything Yorgi says?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, you're good.
Go to hell!
What's that?
Where are we going?
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Aren't you afraid?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Alright, so I'll get more.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Dude, what are you doing here?
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
That was for Anders.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Anything else I can get you?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
You should always work with a spotter.
He's uptight.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
The intention of registration act -
I do love a good check mate.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
What did she do to me?
I lost him.
I'll find him.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
What was your grandfather's name?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Baack!
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
Goodbye, darling.
I suppose you're right.
Fron kon steen!
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
I'm sure we will.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Tonight?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
You'll be getting me sad next.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
All right -- where is she?
What monster?
That sound good, boss.
How's everything?
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Raise the platform, hurry!
What are you going to do?
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
What?
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
His what??
How long is it so far?

Food!
Do you have a reservation?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
