Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Where?
Let's go.
Queen Harry?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
In 9th.  For a month
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You wanna go out with him?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
You just said
Forget it.
A deal's a deal.
You and Verona?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Who cares?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
You 're so --
So what did I have an effect on ?
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Something like that
Hearsay.
What?
Answer the question, Patrick
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
When I go?
Just smack her now.
Just for now.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
But -- who -- what --?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
That's something you can't decide.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Then you are too ambitious.
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
All of them created by people like me.
Thousands.
He understands.
That's what it says.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Immediately.
The land is there.  I know it!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
So...the station is empty?
No.
What are you asking me?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Pouring it out!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
But Chief?  Over this??
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Stay here.
Better than one.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Raw deal.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Alright.
Well, that's great.
Promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
See you later.  Good luck.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Two weeks.
Don't speak Russian!
Good idea!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Be quiet.  Watch.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Milos.  Get my money!
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
I'm here for movies.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Well, he killed my partner!
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Yeah?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Okay, come on down.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Oh?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Are you reasonably awake?
Yes.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Yes, it is.
The antenna has to be replaced.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
How is gregor?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
True.
Roger.
Opening pod bay doors.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Goodbye.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
You're gonna help us take him.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Come on.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Half a million.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Call me later.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Jack, are you okay?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Tell me.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Sure, right.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You chickenshit punk...
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
When is she not in trouble?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Like shit.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
...'Scuse me?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
...Not yet.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Crystal.
Got it...
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Oh god!
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Learning language.
Which one?
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
...What do you mean?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
To fame.. salud..
No... not at all.  Where are you?
I know.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
There's nothing harder.
What are you talking about?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Alright, Tom.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
It's good what you're doing.
I want his name.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
They're no friends of mine.
Enlighten me.
Yeah... guess so.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
He succeeded.
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
That's exactly what I am.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
"In her dream"?
Nice neighborhood.
What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Don't worry, honey
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Alice...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Krueger is reality.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Then we'll find another way.
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
My father!  He's not - ?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
So?
A lot of people think like that.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Somewhere down there?
Seems to be all around...
Yes, Griff?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Yeah. I know about that.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
This spring.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Wonderful!
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Not here.
Shit.
But it's not funny now.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Oh.
Huh?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
Something bugging you?
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
So?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
See. Get your boots.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
For a while.
How's she doing?
I'm sorry.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
It's nice.
Then... I guess you have to.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Can --?
How's that?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
This town sucks.
Marg! You got orders!
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
You and me.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Well, it was an accident.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Money.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
For what?
Back at The Fishbowl?
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Been better, Dad... You?
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Put your pilot on.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Tower, here.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Thank you.
What do you know of my husband?
Yes
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Three...
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Hold on, Alice.
Twenty minutes?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Excuse me?
This is the President.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Sir?
Ask Simon.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Ted!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I mean until we start to burn up.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
You mean...
What will happen to him, Ted?
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
I think so.
Can't we change course?
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
What should I say?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Certainly.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
No. No thank you.
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Yeah...
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
I am George.
How the hell do you know that?
Back off, George.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Stop the car!
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
We can't let him get away.
Only holds five.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
What's that?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
That's right.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
On my way.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Don't be long, Ellen.
You're just reading me.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
No.. I've slept enough.
Why not?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Where?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
Don't bother!
I'll be right back.
I'm so relieved.
And how will you make him keep it?
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Why?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Of course.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Don't be stupid.
No!
Why not? Half the house!
I'm not telling you.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
I see.
Tonight?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Money! Money!
Oh, yes.
Adorable!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Well, look at them.
Ah-ha.
What do you mean, Sire?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How many pupils do you have?
This one will.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
So there you are. What do you say?
Put it down!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Mio caro Adone.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
How could I not?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
I can't say. Really
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
You burned the score?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
You mean she's not coming back?
He knows. He knows!
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
We ended in F Major?
I think so.
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Do you have it?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
On the contrary.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Leave me alone.
Ah - you've heard that?
My son, no one can speak for God.
I did.
Never mind.
Well done, Sire!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
What do you mean - now?
Can we come in?
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
What exactly did he call out?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Sorry.
I'm twenty-seven.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Charming.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Anything.
See you later.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Jack is dead!
No.
No.
No what?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I think he's a Jew.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
David.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I don't know.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
I have no idea.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
What was it?
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
I don't know. Come on.
Let's just keep walking.
Not far enough. Come on.
Are you going to help me up?
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Will you be quiet?!
What?!
Stop it, Jack.
Yes.
What do you think?
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Yeah?
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
We'll discuss that in the board room.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh!
All right, Jack, all right.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I haven't got it.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
See, we're getting along famously!
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Cyril!
My apartment.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Yes, now.
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Happy now?
No.
Yes, sir.
Now don't you worry about it.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Yes.
Yeah.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh now, don't be silly.
Mr. Williams . . .
No. It wasn't earlier because...
wasn't anywhere near this place—
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
He's not bad at it.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
A trap.
Pass me some whisky.
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Get buckets!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
Shit.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I figure.
I reckoned.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
We're doing this for Ma.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Let me see that.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Really?
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
How much did they get from the safe?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
I can't believe this.
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
You like it there, don't you?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
I'm ignoring you.
Why?
Yes, Courtney?
Really?
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Everybody's rich.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
But what about the past? Our past?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm just leaving.
Good coloring.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Yes, naturally.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Where are you going?
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Negative. Cancel it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Interesting.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Why?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
That's...that's too bad.
Who?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Nice. Very nice.
You sure?
No. Not really.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
We were both seven in 1969.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Yes.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
I've been great. And you?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
Isn't that -- extreme?
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
We could move 'em up here.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
That's what I told her. My wife.
The wrong place?
'Sorry about the late notice...
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
What?
I mean, it's your life.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Show me.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
But why would they --?
They'd frame him.
Hmm?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
You may.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
To my health.
Is it about my teeth?
Smashing!
Thank you.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Carnies.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
My meat and two veg.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Do you want to talk to him?
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
Why?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Yes.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Lay it on me.
Danger's my middle name.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
An evil petting zoo?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Why?
We don't judge here.
And how do you feel about that?
Scott.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Red ...
Three days.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Promised? Who promised?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Thanks, Valentine ...
I'm already married ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Valentine, listen to me ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I'll never marry you.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Strange.
Did he say who?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Was I?
Nothing personal.
Because you always obey orders ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Is that all?
I'm playing to win.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
It's called Black Leather.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Not quite.
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Peter's brother?  But --
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Impossible.
Both, actually.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Did I? My mistake.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
The best.
Shit!
Fan out and look for them.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Yes, sir.
What are we having?
Are you going to have women at your party?
You better not have too much joy.
Can't I just go with you guys?
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I am committed. I love you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Let's have a toast.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
You've been having strange sex...!
Then it's on to the real thing.
This isn't right.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
You got it.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Yeah...
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Just come down, John. Just --
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
What are we going to do about this?
Thanks for calling.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.
Just take it.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
The outlets.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
I don't work for them, either.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Are you going public with this?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Yeah.
Four months?
Every little boy's fantasy.
Backdraft.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
They're waitin' man.
He's got piano lessons.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
You treated me like shit.
-- Burn them.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Alderman.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
Yeah.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
"The Strawberries"?
Yes.
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
How about 7 1/2?
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What money?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
You've really got a problem.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
I'm out.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
EUREKA!!
I won't do it anymore.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Exactly!
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
How did you end up here?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
We both lied to him.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
Is that good or bad?
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Work related or otherwise?
I feel fine.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
I'll be right over.
Finland.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
We should go out on a double date.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...too early...
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
You look beautiful like that.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
You can go now.
That is none of your business.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
It must have been some other gate.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
It is my only object.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
And he doesn't care about me?
Shut up.  West's dead.
I asked for a policeman.
I'm serious --
Yeah --
Why?
West... he's dead.
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Mueller.
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Where are they!
Tell me what I can do.
Well, he's a good soldier.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
That's horseshit and you know it.
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Got it.
I lied. Wait for it...
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
What?
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
You wanted to get the truth.
Nah.
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
What are you talking about?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
He wanted more than that.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Shut up!
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes!
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Edward Bloom.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How did you know?
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
And I like you.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
What's your name, Giant?
You don't like it?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Did you do any of that?
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Really.
You know where the chemicals are?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
It would kill you, huh?
You say...
There is no softer ground than town.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
So you never bought any land.
You know what for.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Do you want to stop?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Yeah.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
No I haven't.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
I...
Tell me.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
Yes.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
You don't want to talk about it.
So now you hate all women?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Nobody's that unhappy.
I don't want anyone to die.
Whatever.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Well. It's good to see you.
Yes?
I need to uh...
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Can I put it in your mouth?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Wait. He left.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Whose doin' is that?
I CAN'T!
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
By myself?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Get a good picture in your mind.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
I do.
Why she got a chain on her?
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
You could put it that way.
Yeah?
What?
Yeah, I do.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Get rid of it.
Why?
Charlie...
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Number five with a bullet.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
No one's keeping him here.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Where?
Would you like to be modified?
What's the problem?
I am?
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
You didn't like her!?
Yeah.  I got it.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
How do I stop one?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Thank you very much.
Money?
Let's hear it.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
What night?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
I bet I would.
I'd kill it.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Sit.
Dead.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Ten years.
No, I don't.
Just wait here.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
We sure did.
Thanks.
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Eve? I'm leaving.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Oh, that's nice.
Right.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
And that's it?
Okay.
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
What's fair?
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
One who's not a mutant.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Stop that ma'am crap!
I told you I've never driven before!
I like it.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Not that one!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
How 'bout this one?
I'm sorry.
Goodnight!
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
No kidding!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Shit is a French word?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Not particularly.
And it's called...?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Who use to own it?
It's so small.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
That would knock my father out.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I just don't want to.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
So, did you buy a movie?
My father is a genius.
Just look!!
Hi.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I'll be all right.
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Well, put it down and come in!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Yes.  Well... yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
Amen.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Oh, my God...
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
He's from Alaska.
We did not leave together.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
To bed?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or have perfect table manners.
Fallout shelter.
Then what?
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
No, not at all.
You're all through with this now?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Well.
No way.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Frank? Can you stand up?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Yes.
Hello.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
I asked first.
You what?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Can I feel 'em?
What?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.
No. No thank you.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Two.
He got a little jealous.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
You better not, Jeffrey.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Just a minute.
No.
Probably not. No. Why?
Up where?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
Know any other languages?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Right.
Okay. We're ready.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Just like on TV.
Aye.
Oh, we're good man.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Yes.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Rule of thumb?
Yeah?
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
My, my...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
What about one guy with two guns?
Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Eight.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
What are you serious?
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
No. You sure you're okay?
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
You know them personally?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Forgive me father.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Right here.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you say so.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
I'm not. But there's --
Sure.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
It's like we've finally arrived.
As a person?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I'll see you there.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
What'd he get?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Thanks.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
No, that door over there.
No. Bob did.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
See you, Bob.
Is that OK?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
It was stupid.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
No.
Like silk?
Yeah.
Is that Buckethead?
What's he doing here?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
OK, Bob.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
I warned you, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
He electrocuted someone?
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
It's registered in my mother's name.
Bob, that makes no sense.
What is it?
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
That's OK.
Yeah?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Now!
I'm working on it.
I'm trying.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
He said what?
Oh, yeah.
He's damn good.
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
Got a little lucky.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
I want to know about Treadstone.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Did he say anything to you?
Had to be done.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
It was staged?
Conklin.
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
-- my coat -- but we should --
But we were so careful.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Where are you going?
Tell me later.
I did.
A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
You never worked Berlin...
Are you disappointed?
Sounds like a threat.
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
Is there. Is all there.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Yes. In that order.
We cannot defeat this --
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
A common thief.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Humbly, M'lord.
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
Nor I!
How do you know this?
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
So what did you find.
My father has a bad memory, too?
Okay.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Sure...
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
So you believe me?
I thought you were a December baby.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Huh?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Hi, Lenny.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Kayleigh? What happened?
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Hey, I got no choice.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Gee, thanks friend.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Huh?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
You're such a retard!
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
So you decided to go to America.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Uh huh.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
It doesn't matter.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
I love you very much, my dear.
-- Is what?
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
My office.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Yes, rather.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Yes.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Our entertainment is enough.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Okay.
He is traveling with a lady.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
-- Thanks. I will.
Yeah? Why?
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Serves me right for not being musical.
I think perhaps you're right.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
What is your nationality?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Get me the Radio Tower!
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
He'll double what I pay you.
Not right now.
You ever going to bed?
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Just a little something of my own.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Do too much, I'll die.
Fix raft first.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Had a package to deliver.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
I have to.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I would have done the same thing.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Yeah.
Let's eat.
So did I.
But I might not have.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
Forty-three days.
To life.
That's all there is.
May I ask, where are you bound?
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
I was!
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Where's Mandalay?
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Well, we have to help her!
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Nothing.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
He's leaving...
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you know your mother better?
What's a nanny do?
Someone not from Maine.
Is that soon?
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Actually, I volunteered.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
You still doin' it too fast!
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Right.
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
No trouble.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
When will he be home, Major?
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Everything looks in order.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Know who I am, Jake?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
And these cops? What do they get?
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
We pay better.
You sure?
Minus one.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Come here!
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Did I miss something?
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Intuition.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
That was fucking deep.
Eee Oott Auught!
A little bit of both.
The King.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
We're here.
I'll take you up on that.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
I despise the job.
What are you talking about?
You're all scumbags.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about five hundred.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
Who was he?
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
And your lady?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
Not entirely.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I want to hear it.
What about a drink on the way home?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Really?
Then what?
I want to buy a car.
How can anyone be that naive?
Well, thank you anyway.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
Turn left ahead.
You don't like cheats, do you.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
I can't do it, Jani.
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I told you, all bets are off.
I have to take the car.
Yes.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
And what do you do, Lucy?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Give me 365.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
He's a good customer.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
I read the same here.
Talby, can you read me?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Hello, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
That is correct.
Yes, well...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Naah. All stable.
What?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Oh, sure.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Phoenix?
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
This.
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you doing?
Can I say something in my defense?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
No way.
Don't look down.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
A grand.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
No...
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
When?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
It was open.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
You need to get out more.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
I already don't like the sound of this.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Somebody's got to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
With your help.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
I understand.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Got a pencil?
I'm on my way.
Straight.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
A long time.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
What if he's on the level?
What's up?
But there's another side--
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
She tells you how I've been--
How'd you get her out of town?
You don't.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Thanks.
Believe it.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
Bye.
What's it worth to you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
One more time in English.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Oh, yeah...?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
It's my Bullworker.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
That's it?
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
A bustier?
What?
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
We went to a hotel.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Until it withers away.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
And what?
What?
Who?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
But you're OK?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Why? Is this about the book?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Who is the boss?
Yes.
That I did it again.
Who is he going to kill?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Goodbye, Donald.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Yeah, you betcha...
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
I gotta work with these women.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Bye.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Tammy Curry?
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
"My President"...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Half watch dog?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
What do I get?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Then I demand an apology!
What did you say to her?
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
Are you getting tired?
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
And Vera niece, too.
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I thought everything was working out fine.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Two, please.
How lovely.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
What do you mean?
I want him back!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Tell me about it, please!
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Yes.
Want to come out?
Won't be a moment.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
No, nothing.
The main spire.
My... name is...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
Of course! What did you think?
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
Yes, very soon.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Pardon me?
You're losing your temper!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
WELCOME?
But you LOVED her all the same...
Of course.
Yes -- I believe you do.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
Really.
You've got to let me go!
What?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
It saved my father!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
What "magic"?
Like fish.
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
How about making friends?
Let me do something for myself for a change!
The Dragon...
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Can't make enough swords!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
You went berserk...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
No, Mother.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Here we are.
Okay, I guess.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I'm Joel.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
I like to read.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
I'm fine.
You just say. I'm not really --
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I love it!
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Egad, were you horrified?
I remember that speech really well.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
When?
Tomorrow?
Joel, come here. Please.
Hey, Joel --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I can't stop thinking about you.
I just walked in.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Long day thinking.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
You have to stop this!
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
It's not somebody else.
Hi.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
We haven't checked.
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Can I... I brought some --
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Alexander Pope?
It's no big deal.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Then check the connections.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
What is Debbie's position?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Yep.
I'm the best.
Tired...
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Bonanza Jellybean?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
A job for me?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
No, he didn't.
You're okay now, it's over...
Hurry.
Trauma.
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
A power drain --
Pressure?
His peritoneum has ruptured...
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Skipper...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Do it.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Yes...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
Watch me.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Something like that, yeah.
Love to.
Starck, give me a read.
Get out of there now!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
He served on the Goliath.
Not according to the computer.
I don't care.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
1000 meters...
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
I had it at four.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
That's terrible news...
Oh, it is.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
But all these people...
That's the temperature of the sun.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Front page?
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Passion.
Sue... look at your hands.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
You were?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Of course.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
There it is!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Hey-yo.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Where did you hear that?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
All right, then. It's your secret.
You're fired.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Hello.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
No.
Did you get her name?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Ace the jacket.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Damone! You come here?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
I've been swimming, Merv.
I don't go at all.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Believe it.
I know.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
There's nothing to it.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
Sometime?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
I couldn't make it in time.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
No. I mean back to your home.
Two more Cokes.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Awake? What do you mean?
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
A major!
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I want to leave fast.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
How about a check?
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Like big lizards.
They were all veterans.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Do you think you can handle it?
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Yeah.
Where's that?
And the head?
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Follow me.
No. You?
My truck.
We gotta try.
What's in the back?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Seven.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Clear!
If he doesn't shut up...
Am I too heavy for you?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Not without you!!!
I'm fine, I really am.
I'll do anything to help.
I'd like nothing better.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
What?
Come here. I want to show you something.
Who is she?
He's not here.
He knows, Frances.
Fired?
...Yes.
No?
I gotta go now.
I know.
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
I love you too, Francie.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
See you next weekend?
But, Kurt, I...
Oh, Kurt!
Occupation?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Why... yes.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
No, they don't, do they?
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
You can't drink.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Why do you say that?
No, we're not.
And no people.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
You think I got it?
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Normal. Average.
Really? Any problems?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
No!
Yeah?
The music? Or the fire?
Why?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. Very close
Why do you not go to them?
I see it before me.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
I'll be waiting. And watching.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Aren't you?
Nothing can. Not ever.
All my life I've known.
Your decision. For us.
I've no choice
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
They'll hang him all the same.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
You've been going round-the-clock?
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I finished the boats.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
A short somewhere.
Is it stuck?
I don't believe you...
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I guess...
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Best over...
Those things can be nasty.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
How much do I owe you?
For two lonely nights.
Vamanos!
I'm exhausted.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Yes.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Not good enough, swear to God.
No!
Everybody goes home!
What did I say?
Yes.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Feels good.
What?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
Or what?
Really?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
My shit is together.
That's what I hear.
Who's "we"?
I've been accused of that wish.
What'd you find, Kathy?
I'm fine, sir.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Across the board, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
West?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Should probably ask him that.
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
How hard they making it on you?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
He was married?
You got anybody, Wick?
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Smoke it!
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
You heard me.  Move on.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Should I be afraid?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
15, sir.
Your new roommate.
We are so fucked.
So am I.
O'Neil, Jordan.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
The first female President?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Big bites.
Great. See ya then.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Nearly four years...
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Oh my God! They're coming!
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
This is not the place...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
They didn't make it.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
That's right.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Thanks.
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Makes us look more American.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Wait.  Au revoir.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Must be some sort of mining facility.
You go first! There's no time!
Yes. Good was done this .....
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
A boy comes to the door.
No I didn't.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
But you don't?
GO Commander.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
What's the weather like outside?
OK!
It's suicide.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
It's ... incredible.
Yeah, what is it?
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
Only answers to me.
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
What the hell are you talking about?
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
You are so full of shit
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
As you wish.
NO, Thank God he has not.
But... Inside, I have seen-
You can oc that?
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Oh god...
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Because they're coming right at us.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
A lot of years have gone by.
Yes, general.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
We've got powder but no ball!
Then use rocks!
We better, Congress invented him.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Who's in command out there?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
These supplies...?
I rode here, on my horse.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
I think I heard that.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
That's a lie!
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
That's good... who?
I see...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
You're kidding me, right?
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
About sixty.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
In just a second. Two...
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Look at me, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm a producer.
Get him out've here.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
That's right. As a matter of fact...
What does that mean?
Harry, look at me.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
What do you get out of this?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Like this?
That's not bad.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
I'll find you, Leo...
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
There a part in it for you?
What do you get out of it?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Are you going down?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
What money?
Hello, Martin.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
That's what it says.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Why not?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
If you get it back in one piece.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Turbine rotor's shot.
But how long?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
That's what I call a payday.
Because of the gold.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
You just shoot at something?
Collision? With what?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Let the buyer beware.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Drink up then.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Better late than never.
How should I know?
What is it now?
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Are you going to yell at me?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Hi.
What do you mean "why"?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
That lets us off the hook.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Oh, we totally have to.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
What are you talking about -- who?
You're better at it.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What are you talking about?
Just promise you'll do it.
Fuck you, bitch!
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Wait...
Anthony's II!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
Yeah, thanks.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I don't believe you.
Why? What did he say?
So where's all your stuff?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
That's okay...
Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Sure, I guess.
Really? Can I see it?
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Well are --
PLEASE? We have to!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Just wait here.
Hooray for me.
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
YAAA!
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
...I better not...
And you like them?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What's the matter?
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
Yeah, well... me neither...
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
No... they said she was here...
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Let me see the sick.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You've never built in Africa.
But overall, you're pleased?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Then we agree. 
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
What did I do?
We need to talk.
Somehow I guessed. 
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Because I think they're after you.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Thank you, Samuel.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I'd rather not.
Does he ever mention me?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I don't know what to do anymore.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Same difference.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
What are you doing up here?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.

-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
No, the slime is rising.
Who?
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I hate Jello.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Well don't think!
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
What's the matter, dear?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, Louis?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
You're the best one in your row.
Can't you tell me now?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Take me now.
I want you inside me.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Is that a game?
What is it?
I don't believe in luck.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Great!  How's it going?
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
That's "Peck!"
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Why not?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
All right, Peter.  Good night.
Gozer.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
That appears to be the case.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Right.  We'll believe anything.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
For the gods, spit it out!
You're coming back?
Do you want posters, too?
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
That this illness has clouded his mind.
They won't break this one.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
He left us at dawn.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
God of passages and changes?
I hope you live to see what I believe...
You're hearing about somebody else.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
What deal?
I can't let you do that.
I was summoned.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I don't want you to die!
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No, I couldn't.
All right.
Yes.
Did they ever find out?
Ah. Where?
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Did you say rape her?
Because it isn't true.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
My belt.
Well -- where are you going?
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Shhhh.
Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
What?
I'm in the bathroom.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Give me an hour.
What?
Sir?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
No.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Sit down.
What is wrong with me?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Why is it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Very well. Thank you.
Waiter!
I'll be up in five minutes.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
You what?
That you're afraid --
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Go ahead then.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
I don't.
Do you really want me to?
I got up.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
We don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Not particularly.
Art.
Art?
No.
Because I don't want you to.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Let's drop it.
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
You wouldn't.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Hey -- I don't get it.
What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
I don't know. I want it to be --
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
You'll never be young again.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
No, I don't.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Why?
With the pearls?
You can't.
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Reducing?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Too bad.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Am I quite strange to you?
I want to be alone.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
I should like to smoke.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
As you will.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Good heavens. What for?
I don't know.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Oh -- but -- I --
You are ill.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Later?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
I'm the stenographer.
What?
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Shhh -- here he is now.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
You see -- what we are interested in --
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Such nonsense.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Please.
I don't know you.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
What is this insolence?
Go away -- go away.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
We must call the police, your excellency.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Good night.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
No.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You'll never shit right again.
You want a drink?
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
These machines -- They're in here.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
Well, uh... No.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Only one tooth?
I guess I owe you my life.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Uh-huh.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
This time...
You're too young. You should be in school.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
You ain't seen nothin.
The long end. Big con.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
Is that right?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Oh, come here.
I went out to Delmar.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit?!
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Nothing's missing?
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
My life is a living hell.
I thought you'd never ask.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Will, sit down...
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Just get on the bus.
Can I come in?
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
What are you looking at?
You're right.  It does sound strange.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Why?  You interested?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Answer what?
Promise?
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
He's gone.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
Didn't recognize you.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
How all the magazines show tits today.
I didn't tell you everything.
This room is full of ghosts.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
First Nagasaki--now this.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You.
You're an imbecile.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Sir?
Is anybody besides you here now?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Man and boy.
College?
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
The smallest thing I've got.
Make it fast.
No.
No.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Disease?
Your old beau?
Paul said you were awfully sick.
A trip, you mean?
I have a brain.
What a honeymoon.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
That's what you're supposed to say.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Such as?...
Tell me about its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
And what is his most cherished possession?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Hope.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Rifle?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
You're begging him to kill you?
No you don't.
No.
I mean it!
There it is.  Give it to me.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
You startled me.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And her fiancé!
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Good night.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
Comical?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
King Arthur.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
New lives begin!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Don't worry about it.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What a relief!
The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
I was afraid to ask.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
My father!
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Good night.
Is he all right?
The park!
You figure!
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
It is?
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
That's the XKE.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
We've got to rescue him.
That's been said before.
It's really that bad?
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Yeah. How did you know?
Yeah.
You making a feature?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Half now, half later.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
A friend.
Jesus.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Is that the way it was with you?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Shit.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Who's paying you?
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
In G.R.? Why?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
That's not true, Mr...?
Yeah.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What you got in mind?
Let's go.
I don't know nothing, man.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
In other words, you want to get laid?
Sounds all right.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Yes, I am.
Oh, I don't have one.
Your tree.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Harold Chasen.
Eh, no.
Yes.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
It's very interesting.
All right.
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
That's a nice teapot.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Well...
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
What is that he's working on?
What were you fighting for?
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
I don't know.
Yes. It's almost there.
It's so blue.
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Do you think there is any life up there?
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Oh, Harold. 
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
At a funeral.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Why?
What about the draft?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Souvenirs?
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
I knew you'd come.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
God, that's terrible.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
What do you mean?
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
WHY?
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
You were ALL human!
The Cenobites.
See what??
-- Hound of resurrection?
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Hostage negotiations.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
What -- ?
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Two steps back, please.
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
No. That wasn't the deal.
Bastard.
I don't want to see the dress.
Sure you are.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
And the blood let you out?
Yes. They'll never find us.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
I'm here.
Oh, babe...
Sure.
Don't go upstairs.
Please. I can't bear it...
Just soda.
That depends.
There's a first time for everything.
Try me.
You'd like the house.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Never better. You sleep well.
I love you, honey.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Are you alright ?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
Terrific.
What band?
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Because it's in The Big Chill.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
I have a television.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Anna Moss.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Oh.  Okay.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Is there a difference?
Nice friend.
What's his name?
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Do it.  Do it.
Who's that?
Yeah.
Hi.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
I suppose so.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
I haven't felt like it.
Will you please just go?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Have you slept with him yet?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You still together?  Going all right?
That bad, eh?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Pigsty.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
To make you feel better.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I'm alright.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Well, you've asked.
Hey.  It's Liz.
Everything go alright?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yes.  You?
Oh, right.  Alright.
Good.
That way.
Well call her mother.
I knew this was going to happen.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Records are those big round black things, right?
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
Yes.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Basil the II.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Where?
Dupont Circle.
No.  I had to talk to you.
Maybe.
You are.  Now.
You make it all sound so simple.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
A little dusty.
Yes.
Just a little crazy.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Will I see you again?
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
You and I should talk first.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
I was nearly killed.
It is less.
This can't be.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I am not ready for this.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
What would you like?
Far away.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Must he go?
Any other I.D.s come up?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Sit.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
You were never a kid.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
He's mistaken.
All I need is time.
Oh yes, more than enough.
Same.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Exactly!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Did you finish the interview?
Out some place.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
No. My mother.
I don't blame them.
How?
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You'll ask me to what?
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
I haven't any hard feelings.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Sweeney.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Okay, Walter. 
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
What happened?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Will you come here?
What is it? Here!
Murder, uh?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Sure.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
What's that -- what's that?
You grey-haired old Judas!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Cover up that transmitter!
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Who is it?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
No, I don't think so.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Say, Hildy...
She and Mollie were talking.
I know.
Apparently so.
Looking for shrapnel.
Bloody.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Air-raid?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Except the servicemen.
They'd gone.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
The ideas you get in your head.
Up to six weeks, I think.
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
I know you mean well.
Cool.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
OK.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
What?
Great story Goober, how much?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
What's that?
I'll help ya.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Hmmmmmmmmm?
I hear ya.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Oh.
Tickets for what?
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Rise and shine.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
I can't believe...
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
That's the understatement of the year.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Firefly.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
What should I do?
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
What.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Oui.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Yes. Happy happy.
Shh.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Gabby, what is it?
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
We still have you and I.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Okay.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
What do you mean?
My brother is discreet.
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
Yeah?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Shut up, you.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
A deer?
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
All right.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Of course not.
Do you like my new look?
I guess.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Such as what womanly things?
Oh boy!
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
And a fact is a fact.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Deal the cards.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Only when I work.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
For me.
Man named Turk Baker?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
They're fine.
I said we're leavin'.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Eddie...
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Glad to meet you.
By all means.
Who's he?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Call it.
Yes.
What?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Do you always ask so many questions?
Hey!
Fifth of scotch?
You told me.
Oh, it's not bad.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Give it back to me.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
No. You?
What's it so hot in here for?
He knows. A lot.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
First time for everything.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
Just for luck.
California. Oakland.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Thousand dollars a game.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
We move.  Place to place.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
We don't know that --
Who?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
What?
Please.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
What did it look like?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Was there anything over the hill?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Where, Jimmy?
I don't see anything.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
Cool.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Did it work?
Then get them out of there.
That's the good news?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
And our troops here?
Then find them.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
What?
Dick-weed.
I didn't even see them fire!
We're already over Mach 2!
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
We're leaving.
Above American soil?
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Peace? No peace.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
All your life.
Do you believe, Marcus?
It's war.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
What were they looking for?
The Grail Diary.
How do you know?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
You did!!
Will you take it easy!
The floor's on fire! See?!
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Good.
I was the next man.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
I don't know. We'll find out.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!
Junior...
Ready.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
A long time to wait.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
My name is Kazim.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Just one arm!
I know the feeling...
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Don't catch cold.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
I'm...inside you.
Yeah?
No.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
You're not crazy.
With a man in my head...
Yeah.
Why? AL  You know too much.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'm not leaving until you do.
Go out, take your first left.
Where are we going?
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
What do you mean?
I don't have any.
It's illegal.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
What is it?
Swim.
The sand.
I don't want to eat it.
Wait.
...Rene...
Don't get too cute.
Voice stress analyzer.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Why don't you get out of my face.
On what?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
I don't trust her.
Not sure at all.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Never mind that, where are we now.
Gimme a minute.
You've changed your mind.
Yeah, sure.
I'll get us out of here.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
What part what?
Then what?
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
And how do you service foreigners.
What?
Your memory.
Oh.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Oh yeah, thanks...
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
Yessir...very good sir.
What do you want?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
I just work for the travel firm.
...and sort of...disinterest.
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
You did.
They left. I had to go with them.
Who else is interested in me?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
Sure I can, can't I?
Can't you do something?
What?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Why?
It will be fine. You have another.
Could I have it, please.
It doesn't hurt.
What does he know?
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
Mom.
You got a deal. 
P.J.'s.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
Maybe later.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
Are you sure?
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Yeah?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Is there any more rice...?
What do you need at the store?
That's my stuff from the office...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Let me call you back...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
It would be better if he called us.
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Good.  You have kids?
Tempura...
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Did you have a good day?
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
A delivery device for nicotine.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Well, I wouldn't say --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Who's the pigeon?
Triple!
Uh... poetry recitation.
Sustained.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
What?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
What is your husband's profession?
You don't believe in it.
What is it you're after, Miles?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
So I hear. Is that all?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
She held that against you?
No.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Miles.
I have a surprise for you.
What do you want?
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
You do? You do love me?
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Forgery? Fraud?
Murder?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Jesus.
Well what does he want?
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
But you're going through with it?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Well -- is that possible?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
What are they?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
She owes me a meal.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
We'll go into that some other time.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Stunt?
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I don't know.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
I haven't the slightest idea.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Huh?
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
Yes.
What are you talking about?
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
You're on a budget from now on.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Your ego is colossal.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Outside!
Like this. I have no robe.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Not as long as I'm alive.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Not a one.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Oh, no!
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What for?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Not interested. 
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
Yes—if he is your husband.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Yes?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
The dame's too smart for him.
Up yonder. See the lights?
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Don't "Joe" me.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
You're drunk.
Well, I got it, Joe.
I'd put you there myself.
You!
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I ain't got a hat.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah. Come on—come on!
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Five G's—or I crab the works.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Sure. Anything you say.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
No, I'm not...
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
You're not digging.
What's the other name?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
Gee, thanks boss.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
There's a word - orders.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Why Galveston?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
Allen Dulles?
They're gonna love you, chief.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Six.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Thanks.
I know. That's why I went.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I understand.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
What'd ya mean?
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Course you didn't.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I found out.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
What's in it?
Beauty products.
Thanks.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
It's kind of a sports bar
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
It was the other guy who busted me.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
Who is this?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
They seem to like the idea.
Right around here, in the food court.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
And is that it?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Do you think they bought it?
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Less ten percent.
Not after they're dead.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
What the fuck is that shit?
She told you that?
Was she there?
Uh-huh.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Si.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
What about you?
Uh-uh.
Dreaming.
Are you getting that black suit?
You betcha.
Got some o.j.?
Yeah.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I knew it.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I told them.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Yeah, I think a woman.
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's the idea.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
How do you know she did that?
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Bank robbery.
I thought you were sixteen.
Detroit.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Must of made quite an impression.
Yeah.
He went to meet that stewardess.
You live with him.
All right already.
Are you sweating?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Yep.
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Came outta where?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
How am I supposed to know that?
Yeah.
You have it with you?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
I need your name and address.
House.
I got some more business for ya.
It still sounds high.
You didn't hear?
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
'Ola!
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
How do you know?
Me, too.
Oh God!
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
Now what?
Don't go.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
You need ... a doctor.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
A couple of weeks, I think.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
You should go back to her.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
But I see them.
Hell, you think I am?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Why you left.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I just want to look ...
What's wrong?
They're like demons, Jez.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
It's gone to the top.
The numbers stop at 107.
Get your clothes off.
That's your decision.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
How come? The army?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What? What do you mean?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
West.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
What is it?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Just relax.
I would have stayed there if I could.
What?!
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
The army?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Speaking of which, duck!
Oh, come on!
What do you mean, not enough time?
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
Done?
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
And now we're all out of it.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
You got that right.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Where is he?
Give me a break! What happened?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
I'm pulling, damnit!
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
He was chasing me!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Ssh.
What?!!
I gotta go back.
But?!!
Nanotechnology.
Are you finished?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
I want him out of the ocean.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
Who's driving the boat?
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
The bilge pumps. There --
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
No!
He's taken him!
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
My kids were on that beach...
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Think the tide's with us?
I didn't know her.
What's the matter with my printing?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Twenty years.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
And I'll drink to yours.
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Thanks for the message.
I don't like Katrina.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Why?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
I know enough.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
No, more commercial stuff.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
I know what junk is.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What's the matter?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Room with a toilet, got it.
Your name, please?
You're pregnant?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Yeah, like people in love.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Thundercats are go!
Is this Juno?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
You sound shocked or something.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
They're yellow.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Looks like it, yeah.
Carrie.
Karma.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
How'd you meet Early?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
I heard that.
Early, sing me a song.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
I don't want to talk about it.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Where would we find him?
Were they wearing condoms?
Was up bitch?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Let me smell it again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. She's only 13.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
Why I give pennies?
So.
Where you at?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Right now?
She won't? Why not?
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Bang up stuff.
Why is that?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
Am I getting warm?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
I gotta find him.
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Whah is dissdee?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Sweet.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
You've heard the stories right?
No. I was just kidding.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Yep.
It's very monotonous.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
Yeah.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
What?
I wouldn't know.
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Just like who?
I'm just trying to play the game.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
Bingo.
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
It's important.
What about the way he arranged the body?
Meaning?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
You're always in the middle of a match.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
It's alright.
How come you don't stay with them?
When I was very young.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I don't think I could.
Another kind of game?
Of course.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It was.
What?  By attacking me?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
You don't understand.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Colwyn ...
I don't know how.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
Turold's son was to marry her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
I cannot.
Fame.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
No.
A small house.
I only want one.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
It's right behind you.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
We have plenty of hares.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
Freylag's stronghold?
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Yes. We lost five.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
She has the power to kill.
It is too late. He has drunk.
I was beautiful then.
But you would not stay with me.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
...Office 2702.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Yes.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Good.
Huh... 500 meters?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
What?
OK.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
...Because I feel it.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
No.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Yes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...And how much is it?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
It's impossible.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
I've changed my mind.
Don't be so sure.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
Pacifica, California.
From where?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Not our problem.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
It has to be a full character's name.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
I need your help.
Good morning.
Oh, that's not mine.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Orange soda?
No.
Water?
Water.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
OK... whatever.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
You do?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Right... OK...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
We?
Can we just forget it?
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
I have a 4.0.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
Are we done for today?
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
I guess.
Who's askin'?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
So everything you just said --
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Really? Thanks.
Really?
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
What happened?
Really --
Why not?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
And I fully support that.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Are you serious?
Yes.
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Where's the Rock?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
You go to lady now?
You're magnificent.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Or looked so beautiful...
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Something's coming.
The colt's still too small.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Good plan that.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
That's it!
Fire away!
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Patience, lad.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
That's it then... the ring!
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Or perchance...
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
What's the matter?
They rival the angels of paradise.
Who?
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
You're teasing still.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Dead, dead, dead.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
We wait.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Oh, but I have.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Oh.
What's wrong?
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I'll survive.
Monday.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What did you think it would be?
Tell him I said "hi".
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Okay.  I guess.
I don't wanna go.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He's not the type to worry.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
If that's what it takes.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
I'm not.
Maybe that's too long.
I hate this job.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Well, I feel better about this now.
What can I do for you, George?
I'm sorry.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
I'm not going!
I'll hate you forever.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
I'm not doing it!
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You can't make me do a thing.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
Don't.  I don't want it.
Try it.  It feels good.
What do you know about me?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Left you this place.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Why call me?
Money?
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
What?
I used to live here.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
I think so.
That was the truth.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
If I weren't married?
Peter left me yesterday.
So could I.
Nothing.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
His father is a man.
What are you doing home?
That's the problem.
Please don't leave me.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
She's doing just fine.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Married?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Like this?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
So you made a generous contribution.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
Forget it.
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I can't eat it with mustard.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Whatever.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Goodnight, Ray.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Go where, Ray?
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
So?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Move it out.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
You shouldn't have come here.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You mother...
Show him Central Park.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
You did it for Namath.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Now you're talking.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Peppermint... alright.
That way.
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You keep a bat under your seat?
You smell like coconuts.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
East Rutherford.
See something you like, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Anything to eat?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
And I did it myself right on there.
Did you?
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
No.  Just no.
I'm not armed.  Well?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
It's different now. Help me.
I don't..
What do you need?
I wish I could help you.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I have.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
They won't listen.
It's the only way.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
...But I still have the choice...?
Then the answer's yes...
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
What's that?
Oh, my...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
No, no, no
Not yet.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Oh, yes... I think...
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Listen.
Sure, I'm okay.
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah... Laurent.
I don't know.
It's me...
Okay...
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
What deal?
Yeah.
Andy?
Why are ya goin' so early?
Yes, I believe so.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
No.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
What's the word on the street?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
He didn't come home.
No... I don't. Why?
FUCKIN' "A".
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
What night?
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
Thanks, guys.
They're gonna cook him.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Pornos?
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Sure.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Thank you.
I'm a paleontologist.
A paleontologist.
Found in Asia!
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
The police?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Certainly not!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Think of it! In times like these.
No.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
So there are others?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
—buy and sell?
Well, is it?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Now, what would you like to do?
Oh, immediately.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Yes.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Why not?
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
The clothes?
What about the others?
Come on! We're wasting time!
was saying—
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
You see, it's not a dream.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Please don't go.
Hesitated, sir.
Cowan--
No. just peace on Earth.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
We're the government, Cowan.
Mrs. Edelson?
What happens if I say no?
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
I'd go with number three.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
Right.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
What if he's telling the truth?
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Out of focus?
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Maybe you need a closer look.
You figured what?
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Actually, yeah--
This guy.  Where was he?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
Oh shit!
Can you see?
Who?
He won't.
Why?
Just some guy... they found.
They were performance pieces.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Try again.
Lara --
Tuck in your shirt.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You're kidding, that's today?
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Uh, sir...
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Georgetown.
That was easy.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Just a nickname.
Flaws.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Then take her to Radio Shack.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
The precogs were wrong.
And how would I know that?
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I believe in that system...
Do you?  Really?
The safest place of all.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
What?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
I wanna kill my boss.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
We can stop him.
No.  He can't...
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
Have you been there recently?
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
To what?  Trap him?
Tell me how all this works.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Good luck.
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Yes, sir.
I can take you down there.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Manhattan.
No.
He's okay.
Bullshit.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
I love you. Come home.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I'm ready.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Max offered to stake me.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
What's his name?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
No.
Sure. Yeah.
A million. Easy.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
I know.
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
What is it?
Yes. Goodbye.
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
Where's the drop?
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Bobby.
Yeah.
Understand me?
I'll page you.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I'll page you with the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
What are we delivering?
Seat belt.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
She really liked the kitchen.
I'll get the girl.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
So we're working?
You too?
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You're out of money?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Yeah. I want it.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
How much is what?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Come, now. You just got here.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
We're square.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
What about my keys?
Yes.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
I like you, country.
Why?
Solid, daddy.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
That really you, Red?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
That's what Mama used to say.
What the hell for, man?
Read it and keep on reading.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Next week, Brother Minister.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
How do you like it?
Just hold me.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Please make way, please --
What does Sidney say?
You're my father.
Fine as May wine.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Head nigger in charge?
Watch your tongue, boy.
What do you want?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
So what do I get in return?
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[The what?]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Correct!]
[And I had my men ready.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Don't give me that bullshit.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Different door. Not far from here.
No.
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
The traffic takes some getting used to.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Then don't come.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Do you know what she told me last night?
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
She understands men.
I'm trying, mom.
Don't forget your towel.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
I think it's fantastic.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
He has to go.
[Is that good or bad?]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Are you kidding?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
I feel fine.
Oh.
I don't think I remember him.
Who?
It's her baby too, you know.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Oh, that's a sad story.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
You gotta good heart.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
On accounta...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Tommy...
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Pour one for Painless.
Duke Forrest.
I got some.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
And it's the ninth inning.
Call Dago Red.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Any time. Whenever we want.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Right.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
No, no, that one.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
Oh, Jesus.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It isn't always this rough?
Our minds?
But I'm married.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You think he won't.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Duke...
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Thanks.
Glad to help.
What's wrong with him?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
Just in dreams?
You can cut the bow.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Sir?
Morning, Radar. How were things?
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Boys, we're home free.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Are you all right?
Against anything. Just protest.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Yes, sir.
The Websters.
The letter.
There is no letter.
What John Doe?
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
I wish he had a family, though.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
I got it all ready. Here.
Shut up!
Beany!
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
It must be some kind of a gag.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Huh? Get what?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Good night, John.
What?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
SWAT wants to go in.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
What happened, Mike.
That's right.
What's the suspect's name?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Roper, we're into it...
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
How do you feel after a shooting.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
We could fill it with water.
I don't really like to drink.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
I think so.
So what do I say to this guy?
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
We lost.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
That's a chance I gotta take.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
If you did, you never showed it.
As a matter of fact, I do.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
What?
What do you think would be in order?
Okay, I think I could swing that.
What have you promised them?
Yeah, they are but...
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
-- No.
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Then what?
In here I am.
In a computer program.
The new world.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
One would assume so.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
What about the customers with reservations?
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
-- I saw the program.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
What?
It's not used for anything.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
-- Who did he digitize?!
Tanner.
-- Katie.
Yes.
There was no other choice.
Because you'll never believe me.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Uplink selected.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
How can we reach Phaedos?
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Ryan's Comet!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
What do you mean "basically"?
What's going on?!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Poor, yeah.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
If we have to.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
That ain't what your mama said.
I needed to see you again.
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
London?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
A million bucks. In the last six months.
No. We ain't even...
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
But that's an hour's drive.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?
I don't fuck my partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
I turned him down flat.
So change it.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
You wouldn't live out the week.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Now that's a hard number.
Five CC's.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
<u>Why</u>??
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Tell me what?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
My <u>tail</u> itches.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
What?
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
... What are they all doing there?
How are you doing sweetheart?
But I was dusting.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Really?
What does he do?
He's an organic farmer.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
I did not--
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
Who?
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Well, let's get going.
My first name's--Clarissa.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Why me?
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Now, pet--  Jim!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Horace Mill--!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Me! Jim--how--?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Ma! Hold him!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Yes, I was--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh, just a day--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Some committee's got it.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Saunders--
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
You were about to recognize me, sir--
What! Who?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What's the matter?
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Do you?
He did it.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Anything *better* to offer?
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Why not?
Your Honor!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but I—
Yes!!!
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
I enjoy it.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
What's that?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
It had better be good.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
You threw them out!
A girl?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Shhh!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
I wish you luck, sir.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
What was that you said he was?
But your honor—
Hang up.
Hang up.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
All right.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Nah.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Are those stories true?
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Naturally.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
A child? My uncle's?
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Binge?
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Yes, ma'am.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Is she home?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Yes, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Uh-huh.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I'm fine.
My approach?
Why not?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Mr. Follett.
No?
What?!
Should I open it now?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
You do?
Lily.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
I've offended you!
Really? What would it take?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
And he's where?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
I don't follow you.
Hello.
You deserve it.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
How are you?
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Yep.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
You shall see.
What does he want the book for?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Twenty.
Really want to know?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
No, we are not.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
Except for one little thing.
It must have slipped my mind.
But in fact... you'd found it.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Doctor Heller?
It's me... Elizabeth.
Get on to yourself!
Why bother?
Captain who?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Monica, where are you?
What?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
My heart died a long time ago.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
He hasn't stolen it yet.
We're superheroes.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
I use it... to fight evil.
Or both.
Sorry.
Shut up.
The who?
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Where are they?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Properly arranged, yes.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Fair enough.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And where is Joseph?
That is incredible.
Oh -- where do you come from?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
How did it spread so quickly?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, it must be.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Ah, that is good.
Yes.
Were any of them married?
All right -- I promise.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Yes!!
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
What are you talking about?
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
My God, what do you think?
How do you know?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Yes, he has.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Naw, it ain't like that.
You paid cash?
Why you say that?
Suga!
I'm his cousin.
Fuck, what's his name?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Damn, you got a stalker.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I didn't see nothing.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
I don't play for no team.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
He's inside the house?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Good, let's get out.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
What happened here?
Uh, yes..
What the hell are you saying?
For what?
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Me?
He's dead?
You fucked up.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
Let me talk to her again.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I think you're right.
How did you see us kiss?
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Oh, man...
Cover your mouth.
What are you supposed to do?
What are you going to do?
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
You have, huh?
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
Help me get her off the rug.
What gives?
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Walt!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
The devil wins sometimes!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
To see Dad?
I'll make coffee.
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Harry, what --
It's about that John and that Pearl?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Lord will provide.
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
Jesus.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
No.
Who?
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
What!?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
You know he's dead though, right?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Dead and gone.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Bring me forty-five back.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
And you too, Ninotchka.
Well, a hat...
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
I can tell you exactly.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Right now it's on the balcony.
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Good morning, Gaston.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Have you?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Yes.
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Brave... that's right.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
That's even better.
Well, we're back home.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Business.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Confess what?
I think so too.
How long do we have to wait here?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Thank you.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
And where are we?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I don't like your following me.
Will you smile?
At what?
No.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
My darling.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
All right.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
It is their wish.
Yes, sweetheart. 
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
No... please...
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Hello.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
What?
I must ask you to leave.
Yes.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is it?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
So ... let's go ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
No, we have nothing to hide.
I'll bet he would.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
You think this is just about politics?
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
There's no secrets here, Al.
I don't have a pistol.
Cox!  Fire him.
I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first.  And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Can we get around this, Al?
What do you mean, sir?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
It's the parents' fault really.
What?
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Let him finish, Bob.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
Kissinger?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
We'll see about that.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
There's no other choice.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
How a fat man gets so many girls.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Free, if you're the president.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You're shittin' me.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
Maybe I am.
The hell with 'em.
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
It's hard to lose ...
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
You.  What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
I am older.
When did he die?
Most don't.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
He's real all right.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
You ain't heard from him?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
That from the lock?
Sheriff?
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Don't hurt no one.
To your husband.
That'll be the day.
Well -- how come?
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
What did you tell him?
I know where the money is.
I know something better.
I know where it's going to be.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Yeah? Where am I?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
You already asked me that.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Sir?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I got beers in my room.
Then you'll like me.
Took me about three hours.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
I don't know. American citizens.
What outfit.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
...I meant your food.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Tell him what you told me.
I know plenty.
Oh. How come?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I am?
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
I gotta go make dinner.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks...
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
...did I win some contest?
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Who?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
He is real.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
No, almost never.
Rosa...
Your husband?!
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
No, that should be more than --
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Really. And where was that, old man?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
IT SURE IS!!
...that's a good motto.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
Half.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
What?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
What's wrong with you?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
...who doesn't?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I don't know, George...
Hmm?
...yeah.
No! Let me try this!
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Mr. Campbell?
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Four hundred, Delmar.
Everett, my beard itches.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Powas p'suasion.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's good, honey.
You said -
You -
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
It was a powerful air.
He ain't our daddy!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Naw. That's over with.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
I'm doing okay, sir.
He was. He died.
We don't have to talk at all.
Or we could do that yeah.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Then, I'll see you around.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Sid, there's no baby.
I got my foot on the floor.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
I don't want you to move.
Does it still hurt?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Sure.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Not with me.  Not with people.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
This is ridiculous...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
She better.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Pure idiot.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
I don't get it.
Not at all.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
I heard you.
Huh uh.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Who's they?
You know it. Stay Black...
Man, fuck you!!!
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
No sir he didn't.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
I don't know about that.
What?
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
It's a start.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
The hell I do.
He's my father.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Sir.
Perhaps.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
And the Governor?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Yes.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
Cheraw Falls.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
It's Mister Marion.
We saw.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
God willing.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
You believe in it.
Yeah, sure.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
What?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
I'll watch my back.
What're you suggesting?
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Aye, for us there is.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Then why aren't you eating?
Yes, father.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
More to drink!
First -- have you found me a crew?
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
How did he get off the island?
I don't think that will be necessary.
I said, no lies.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Where does it make berth?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
Good.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
No, thank you.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
You're not rotting meat.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
No, Icky, this is real.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Donated to science.  Perfect.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
The big house?
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
That was 'simple'?
Three days ago it was.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
I don't know.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
I have to!
We were different people then.
It's a miracle.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Don't worry, four eyes.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're all right.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Gallagher?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
That's ridiculous.
You're acting like a child.
Why—
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Is that so?
I certainly will.
Oh, is that so?
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Not on my own beat, no.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
What play?
I'm not quitting!
No?
Dawson, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Okay.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
I have it here.
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
You don't.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
All right, Grandma—
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
No, sir!
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Thanks.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
I had to say goodbye.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud brought it to me.
She's crying.
Oh, George ...
I don't want it to go away.
Really Biff? The keenest?
What?
But where would we go?
It is?
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
That's not going to happen!
"Changes."
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
No way.
I don't know.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Play along?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Sure.
Wow.
What?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
What?
Out there.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah.
No I won't. I swear.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
McGinty's.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Because we don't belong!
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
BUD.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
Aren't you a little early?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
So you're coming tonight, right?
Why?
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Why?
I'm gonna call you back.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
Tell me why.
Yes.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Do you like porno movies?
...just talking to you....
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
I'm going to work.
Me?
You don't even know how much it is.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I didn't lie.
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
Thank you.
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
Yes.
Are you learning how to play it?
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Really?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yeah......yeah.....
This is funny.
No.
I cut myself.
How?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
....I have seven.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Ok. You're connected.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
....yes.....
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
You're goin' on a trip?
Where you goin?
Let's just figure that out later --  Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I know.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Are you coming to eat with us?
No.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
He's a writer, not a madman.
Yes, Abbe?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
By whom? The Marquis?
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
It's not even noon --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Good day, Marquis.
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
A man after my own heart...
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
Shut down?
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
And my own.
How is the patient faring?
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Go on, child.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
Forgive me, I beg you --
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
And director.
Oh, why is that?
There's no call for that language-
How much?
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
There is nothing to discuss-
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Not for me.
I just want to understand--
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
I am not doing Hearst.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Please don't say this.
Orson. Stop. Just stop
I don't have it anymore?!
How?
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
No, you gotta hear this-
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Get out.
Again.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
It was fun, wasn't it?
We're from...
I'm Ok.
You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Hit me in the face.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
So what?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Three more, I figure.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Should I hit it?
Do what I say.
Yeah, what?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
I took the kids to my sister's.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Sure, what else is new?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
What friends?
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
I'll bet it's been done.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Do that.
I think they missed their chance with her.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
That depends on who "they" were.
Like an old hambone?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I'll send you some comic books.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Something wrong?
How?
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Lisa Fremont.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
Would four of them -- ?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
No.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
That's good news.
You mean leave the magazine?
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
There's nothing to see.
To get on home.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That's what the witnesses told him.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Too close.
Your name?
Two minutes.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What?
Glad to meet you.
Yeah.
Smashed the front door.
No--
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yes.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
I'm not hungry.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
You're absolutely right!
Well--
You don't?
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
That's right!
Look--just relax, will you?
I still think you should go down.
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
There's only one key.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
No.  At dawn.
They like you.  Okay?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Do I have to spell it out?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
And your folks didn't understand?
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Yes, ma'am.
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Who lives?
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Oh.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing.  What about--
How many rooms do you think there are?
Hi.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
They're killing him!
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Okay.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
What?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
Toys for... adults?
We sell children's toys --
No, c'mon --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
Nick, what are you --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Nick, please, it's me --
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Canada.
He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
What?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
They all are. Football's on.
You said it a million times!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
She says a lot of things.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
NO!
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
Six men means six guns.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
How'd you know my name.
Take 'em.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
GO!!!
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Good for you. Protein.
...for Christmas...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
You ain't dying, he is.
I don't know, but somebody did.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Did the two of you talk?
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Take a seat.
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Dead as Dillinger.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Give me my book.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
No, I'm not!
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
I got the diamonds.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
I don't know anybody.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Nobody. The light was bad.
Look of things, she doesn't.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
You should know. She's in your dream.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
Swimming.
Can I have my gun back?
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Yeah, it does.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Even women?
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Up the trail.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Oh, sure.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Okay.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
He's so brave.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Okay.
Hugh Kane.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Right behind you.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
I'll go.
Oh.
Got my camera right here.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
I wouldn't go that far.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Okay, give me my belt.
How is she?
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Yes.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Don't worry, I got your back.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
No!  It wasn't like gore movies at all!  IT WAS REAL!
You said you hated him.
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
You mean for TV or print?
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oh, honey!
...People who don't mind their own business.
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
GODDAMN YOU!
COCKSUCKER! 
Socially... I'll have a beer.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Yes, but I lent it...
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Can we go there now?
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Yes.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
What circumstances?
Hello, Frances.
I can't understand it at all.
But I like teaching school.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
Redi's all right.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
Yes.
I have something even better.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
But it's a small room, Jason.
I have to go —-
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
I keep telling myself that.
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
She was my patient.
I should like people to read what I've written.
No. She's no longer under my care.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
I'm afraid not.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I didn't know.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
You mean like "time flies"?
Who's Elizabeth?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
You're in therapy?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Everything about sex.
Like what?
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
That's a good question.
It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Yes.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Why?
Yes.
You said you weren't always impotent.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I'm not planning on it.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Not entirely.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
I ate by myself.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Why?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
You bitch. I knew it.
Did you masturbate?
No, I haven't.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
That you are under no obligation to me?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Why did you do that?
I wanted him to see me.
You couldn't do it, period.
You are in serious trouble.
It's a sun dress.
It was busy.
I just want to know why you're here.
Nope.
Spooked.
You just want to ask me questions?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Then what happened?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Why?
Who said I was jealous?
Cynthia. John.
I want to see you.
Nothing wrong with trying.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
You told Ann about this?
What do you mean?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
What do you mean?
So is my wife, asshole!!
No.
Goddamit...
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
All right, jesus.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Sure.
You knew these people?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
OK. But late.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
OK. I'll think about it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
I've caught it once or twice.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
SPONSOR!!!
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
...closed?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
In a little masquerade?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
Of course.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
She walks in beauty...
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Highliner.
Bottle.
I'm good.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Sure is tasty.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
When do we get to drink it?
We should have driven.
So you're going to stop acting?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what's the plan today?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Miles.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
I'm a quick learner.
What?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Yep.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Put me down, Jack.
Let's leave it alone.
I say we check it out. You never know.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Yeah.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What?
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
She got anything good?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Like what a fraud he was.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
See you over there, Miles.
I told you I need a drink.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Does she ever answer back?
You don't even know what that word means.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
I got him.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
What does it matter then?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
They tell you everything in this book.
The family room.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Six months.
It's like War of the Worlds.
You're in here for winging a guy?
All right then.  Let's go.
Where were you?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
They got a saloon there?
Women?
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Who is he?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
We'd rather stay.
Because I'm your sister.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
So we understand each other?
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
I run the place. What can I get you?
You like a good saloon?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
Okay -- for you.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Spare me.
I can't wait to meet her.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Even the fall from the plane?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- I can explain.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Thank you.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
You?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
Somebody said she was here.
I know what you mean.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
Simone!
I was misquoted.
I don't know anything about computers.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
I know.  Thank her for me.
No, that was me.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
They are alive, Sayer.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
Why?
Yes, very.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
But that's Simone's part.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I am the death of real.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Tell me.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Yeah. Sorry.
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
Words.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
What?
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
I guess she did.
Oh.
Don't get mad.
A lady. She died.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Dead people.
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
What are you talking about?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
What's a "little while?"
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Someone actually... employs you?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Not lately.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Not someone -- Mac.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
-- By way of my breasts?
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Name something.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Mmmm -- so can I...
Wait a minute --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Grant.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
How many you need?
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
That's disrespectful.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
You paying for the gas?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
You could've asked.
Uh-oh.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
And?
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
That man is your father?!?
Yes.
I'll do it.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
But I still don't think...
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Let's keep it that way.
Yeah, guy?
You okay?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yes, sir.
That's correct.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
And threw us into the lake.
You woulda?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Look at the collar on that coat...
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Yeah... Sid?
I'm here.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Wow.
Shoot.
A million flat.
None whatsoever.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What!?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
You'll end up like me.
No?  Who am I, then?
A puppet.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Why did you agree to come here?
How quickly?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
And professionally?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Will she come back?
Why?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Get out --
I won't be making the trip.
Jesus...
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
How old were you?
Sartorius.
Was she right?
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I want you here.
Yes, you are --
But then I would be dead now.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I think they help.
I can't --
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Queens... You know Queens?
Beg pardon?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
How did you know?
They're kind of fuzzy.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
But "nice".
What's to like?
Sleep good.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Claire, will you calm down?
They called here after you left...
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
So.
You're planning to speak?
Just putting in an appearance then.
Claire...
I don't know Tommy.
What are you talking about?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I'd identify him.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
What did she say the down payment was?
Did you hear what I said?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
What're you talking about --
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I just sat and listened.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Call a cruiser!
Right behind you, T.J.
Does it make you... hard?
... Hard?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Okay, I guess.
Mom and I got plans.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Remember Little League?
No, no.
Harry…
Mr. Jameson--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Even if they're not clever.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate people with alliterative names.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Hurry up, Flash!
Hi, Adele.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Your dog ate it.
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
Bonkers.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Any news on Dunbar?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Roger.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
It is.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Some are not bad at all.
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Who did?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Check.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
What time?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Full disruptors.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Thanks.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I hope so, sir.
Where is he now?
Why would you want to leave?
I don't understand.
Please, please.
No, no. Thank you.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
Better?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
What's normal?
Thank you, Number One.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
Trilithium?
Aye, sir.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Aye, sir.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Scotty...?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
Not from here, no.
I'll handle that later.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Logic indicates that is the case.
... How long?
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What's wrong?
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
Much is at stake...
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
The ship... Out of danger...?
I'll need it, Sulu.
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Yours...?!
No.
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!

Yes...
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Success, my lord.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Wait!... Wait...
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Ah.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... taking Genesis away from us...
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Who --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
There's an air-lock.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
We appear to have plenty of time.
We encoded four minutes --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
It was just words.
Only half of you would get there.
I don't know.
Visual --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Scotty, let's have it.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
Or the one.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Best we could do in two hours.
You earned it.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Stop engines.
Trying, sir!
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Never, sir.
Aye, sir.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
A moment alone, please.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
I liked him better before he died.
Then how.?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
I was not informed about observers.
The top of what?
Name?
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
I suppose they told you that...?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
I buy that. What about him?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
It's his way.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You need me.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
The late 20th Century.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
How do you know this...?
Yes?
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
The tank will be finished by morning...
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Tell her I feel fine...
But not you.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There are caves in those mountains.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
Is it safe to move her?
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're not finished here?
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
... had regenerated.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
Transferring controls to manual.
Can you beam him off?
Say the greeting again...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
What are they interested in...?
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
That'll be interesting.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Let's go.
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
That's impossible.
Aye, sir.
Steady as she goes.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Aye, sir.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
Destroy the deflector dish.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
I'll keep that in mind.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Where the hell are they going?
Riker here.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Can you - ?
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
That's a comfort...
That isn't true...!
Spoken by you?
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
We must do this again soon.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Energize...
Aye, sir.
WHO ELSE...?
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Sir?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
When does this conference start?
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
What peace conference?
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Faith...?
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
A lie?
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
I don't want to.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Yes, please continue.
No.
No. Can I move now?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
You're working late.
Yes.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
Dying?
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Soon then.  I’ll save the last dance for you.
To new worlds...
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Why?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
And I you.

Thank you, Commander.
What do we know about the population?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
He wants to look me in the eye.
On screen.



Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
A coup d'etat?
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Yes.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
Yes.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Why am I here?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
We are.
I don't know.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
She is here.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I don't want to scare them away.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
I'll take that.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
No.
Where did you stop last?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
This is George Fox...
Marc Shermin.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Gear shift.
Smile.
No gas.
Closed?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Closed.
You want to try it?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
I do not understand.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
When we get here.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
What?
I was afraid.
What is hell?
I am your friend.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Horses.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
If you want to keep it, you can.
Fly.
Get Fox.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Wait'll you see it.
I know, but...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Judy, that's stupid.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
What's all this squid shit?
Yeah, right.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Jesus.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
You think Tran killed her?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Talk to me about costs, here.
What?  Right Here?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Top ten.
Why me?
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
You bet.  Did you like it?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
She never gave me a tape.
I already got everything I need from you.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Are you sure it's real?
That's where it gets a little strange.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Jesus, Mace!
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Yeah.  We did.
Yeah.  See you there.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Um... he was older.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
That's right, Jan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
A grill pattern.
Not as much as you'd think.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Not bad, huh?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Just an observer.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Its called insubordination.
Go ahead.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Sex.
Don't be too harsh.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Just routine stuff.
Sue Ann Hanson.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
And nobody else can do that?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
I don't carry it with me.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[You tell me.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yes, sir.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Murman!
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Are you calling Her?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Are you sure? Maybe...
You too?
Mike...
Oh. You know.
...not until you book it...
...Four days..?
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
He is so sweet.
Sorry?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Why not?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Well, who represents you back east?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Me too.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
I'll give you an eight. 
An eight.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
There's the rub.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Him?
I'll be your winger.
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Damned if I know...
Rejected?
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
What Vegas?
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas.
Whu?
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
That's not cool.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
I know, but...
What an asshole.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
Baby, we're money.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I don't think so.
Yeah, a good friend.
Don't remind me.
...a day...
This version doesn't have fighting?
Yeah.
...It looked money.
What a surprise.
A day.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
You think?
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
You're money.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...it's on.
The Court gave you justice.
But your daughter is still alive.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Sure.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
You understand him better than anyone.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
That's for you to find out.
Mama, no.
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
Thanks Tom.
Did he give you his politicians?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Michael, I love you.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I'm thinking about it.
Tell me you love me.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
One of them fingered the old man.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You think I scam?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Shut up!
I don't get it.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
You'd say if you mind?
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
What?
I played piano in a few places.
Copy out from here...
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
Ha.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Aye, aye.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Have you done something to your hair?
Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Frances?
I'm fine.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I'll go.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
What?
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Tom.
That's a terrific idea.
You've got Dickie's rings.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
No glasses.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily.  Just kidding.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
How did you know that?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
We'll be there.
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Do you want me to stick around?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
No!
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Nah. I ain't interested.
Who mam?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
That's really something.
What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
What?
Oh. Who was that again?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
What's wrong?
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
I mean porno movies.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
This is gotta be a game, right?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Show me how he did that again.
That's fine.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Yeah.
A real skunk.
For a fee.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Oh, come off it, man.
But that one night?
Can I see you again?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
How?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
What do you mean?
No.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Got your license?
Physical? Criminal?
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
It happens.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Don't let him do that.
You suppose?
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
It's about time.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
What's that?  Mason?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Me too.
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
What did... what did I want to be?
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Yes.  Hic!
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
No, sir.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
A statement?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Harry, son.  Harry.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
... Ernie.
I know, I know... keep still.
A few.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
And I won't be a communist anymore.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
No thanks.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Why not?
Not at all.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
Well, that's not what they think.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
The customers?  I don't know...
They will.  They w-w-will.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Who?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
How'd you happen to come here?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Could I have a puff?
Darling, of course I do!
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
It's Alice.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Yep?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Yes?
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
These birds were...
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
How can you tell?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Seven o'clock then.
Famished.
What?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
It is for me.
Cheers.
You have a job?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, I have my things in the car.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Don't let's take any chances.
No... wait.  Hold me.
You said three o'clock.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But you did promise.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
He was a nice horse.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Burke them?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Yes, Doctor.
How long ago?
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
I'll get him.
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Yeah. I sure will.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
Erin. Who?
I know.
I mean Lauren.
What did I say?
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
What do you mean, dear?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
You ready?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
How do you know?
Yes -- Just exactly.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
Remember those words.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
But I suppose you know the answer.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
Star?...
Why?  They're only noodles.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Chill out Edgar.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Did we have a date tonight?
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
You better not like him too much.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Get out, Mom!  Run!
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Mom!
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Hi, Thorn.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I hope so.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Okay.  Talk.
What do you mean?
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Okay.
Save Laddie first.
Will you give Mom a break?
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
What would that make Mom?
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
I know.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
I don't know who to trust.
Was dark... find a light...
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
It's shorted out or something!
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
Then kill me.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Nothing we can do about that.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
He's dead.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Then we go after him.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
The Hall of Books.
What happened?
Around here.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
It frightens you.
The air... the power.
End...?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I don't understand.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
So you take their best...
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
And why not?
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I just love mechanical things.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Dance with me...
Talk away, Professor.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
How romantic...
Perseverance.
Do you find her?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Thank you.
He's gone to a better place.
Why not?
Good night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
We share everything.
Learning was important?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
If you only knew...
Yes... I suppose so.
We are what we are.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
You killed him?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
[Beat] What?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
After I...
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I don't know.
No, he didn't.
To the hospital.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Ok, I guess.
I don't understand.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
So it's helping?
You thought my father was crazy?
I'll die either way.
You have no idea what's going on.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Well, what time is it?
2004.
The future doesn't look different?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
What are you talking about?
Is it true?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
How?
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Oh, great.
What's wrong?
What for?
I'm spinning.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
That sounds nice.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Peaches.
Who is it?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You wanna let me see your license, please?
In the back?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
How come he let you go?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Ready when you are.
West.  Left.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
I think better when I drive.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Will I be?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I heard that.
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Why not?!
Now what what?
You mean now or before?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Yes.
Yeah.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
Oh.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Way up ahead!
What are you talkin' about?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Fresno.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
You got a brew?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
By the way, what's your name?
That sounds like fun.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
What?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Huh... that's strange.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
She's blackmailing you, right?
You want her dead, don't you?
Nope. Never been.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Answer the question, shitball.
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
You were following us?
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I'd go with the seven.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Where would I have seen your work?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Hi, Mary.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I agree there should be more.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
You're Woogie?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
It.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Shhhhhh!
Is that bubble what I think it is?
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Dean Rusk!
Back to work.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
You're sure...
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Hey. Nice tie.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Ray.
Who the fuck is he?
I got one up on ya.
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Yes.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
His spiritual mother...
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Why should I tell you.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
What'd you expect to hear?
1868...
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Great.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Ray. What's your 20?
Mister Tully.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
That's all!
I saw one.
It's classified.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
And far too aggressive.
Too aggressive?
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
What about the plane?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What?
Anything.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why, what's gonna happen?
I was flying...my responsibility.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Hardly ever.
What truth?
Take something off.
That's up to you.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Well?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
No! Now we're inverted!
Not anymore.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Is it you?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
Come on. I died enough for one night.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
No. You can be mine!
Figured out what?
Need a hint?
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
But you continued to fight.
Some guys never get it back.
Didn't everybody?
All right.
Or....
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
And you get a kickback.
Take me to the hotel.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Identification?
Fuck you.
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Don't be an idiot.
You better get down here.
Hetero.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Not since you lost him.
There!  The woman!
Yeah.
Well don't.
The door opened.  You got it.
Quit while you're ahead.
But I'm always home by morning.
I'm late.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Doug...
Doug, don't!
That a problem?
What's in the two week package?
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous.
Jump!
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Burt, can you hear me now?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Could we make it to the mountains?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Why do you all keep asking me?
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Absolutely.
Sustained.
Shut your sewer mouth!
You can't remember that -- !
Not at all --
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- a speed manufacturer --
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Chinatown street gang.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
...For ten years, now.
-- Me? Neither.
You're doing a murder case?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
It was self-defense.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Don Reynard.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
That's right.
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Every word.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
I want you.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Yep, it sure is.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Tell me about the letter.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Where's Hap?
How come Jack let's you work here?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's good.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
I'll get my kit.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Maybe.
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Donna, are you my best friend?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Laura, I am your friend.
I haven't got it yet.
Maybe.
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
Send me a kiss.
We're on our way, Baby.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
When am I going to see you?
Not now.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
Hiking?
Sex?
I understand.
What were you doing in my room?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Mom... what are you wearing?
It's a school night... back by nine.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Ah. How did they treat you?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You would not...?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
I...
You've just said you signed it.
Just as you are, Sir...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
There's nothing they can do to me.
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Why?
Hi. How are you doing?
What did she say?
One hour.
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Concannon...?
Exception!
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
Isn't there something you...
You, you don't under...
Mr. Alito, please.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Yes. Price...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Missus...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
He's not in, Sir.
That's for sure, Frank.
...now who is that...?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
We got to talk.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Huh. And why is that?
How'm I doing so far?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
All right - I've seen enough!
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Like...ah...
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
So?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Just be careful, okay?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Home, that's right.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Black's fine.
Not yet.
He knows.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Claiming their place in the world.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Well, that's all part of it.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
That's not why he's sending me.
It was a bad dream...
I guess.
We all have problems.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Who?
Unfurl the squares!
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
He's a big boy.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
Yes sir.
What's that?
They'll know about it in the morning.
We'll think of something.
Shut up donut.
Sorry won't cut it.
I understand.
I am accountable.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Yessir.
How old are you?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Ready for another?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
What is it?
No shit?!?! You know him?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
I'm sorry.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Stab it and steer.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Yeah, maybe...
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Come look at this.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
What was this one?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
You sick?
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
You talk to 'im some?...
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
What could I be up to, Lula?
What makes sense, is all.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Just a place.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Yes.
Yes.
Santos... I can't...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Actually... I just want to go home.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
He finished it Winter Break.
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Evidently.  Coming!
So whose car is it?
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
You must be mistaken.
The last month maybe.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
No, really...
'Fraid so.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Oh.
Yes.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
I never heard of it.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
I eat.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Grady!
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
It beats 'What's your major?'
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
I love you, Grady.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
About the baby.
James Leer.
And you're old.
Does he still love you?
Why yes. How did you know?
James is... I don't know...
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
This is important.
Oh... yeah.
Her husband.
Ah, right. The book.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Huh?
It's a nice table.
What party?
When?
Soon.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
I have to go.
I have friends.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
No.
I could take you downtown.
And your new apartment?
Lovers' quarrel?
No you're not.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
Do you like it when he asks you?
What will happen if I do?
Robin, listen to me.
It's getting dark. Go home.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
That was a joke.
How's that?
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
Honest? No.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
We have a few more minutes.
I don't.
I don't know.
I don't know!
I don't know.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Sorry.  Where is she?
What's weird about that?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
I like the noise.
Why do you want to know?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
How many girls did you molest?
What did you do to them?
Sounds like a special guy.
Why young girls, Walter?
Nothing. It's over.
I know.
What odds?
You must hate your brothers.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Do what?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Not when they fly.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
I'm taking you back out.
Wasn't up to me.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I'm switching off now.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Fine.  Be that way.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Calm down, Bud.
FUCK LOGIC!!
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
And how do you explain that?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Who knows why they all left...
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
I love you.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
What do you think?
We'll try again.
You men are all so dreadful!
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Is that possible?
Yes.
Why?
Agnes...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
I'm not hungry.
Why?
Dear Jesus...
Why?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Right now?
Yes.
Who?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
No. I was sick.
From their heads...
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Agnes...
Would you like to ask them?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Why do you smoke?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
You have trouble sleeping?
Somebody told her.
A mistake...
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
You're a mistake.
Of telling you.
To be a mother?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
I can't tell you that.
I'm afraid.
Are you ill?
Yes.
Why isn't anyone coming?
Is someone in the room with you?
I hate him...
I hate him.
I don't remember.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
What?
Thanks...
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
I'll have it.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Yes... I...
I can beat that.
I haven't a clue.
And you didn't try to find out who?
So, someone else could have done it.
And you weren't shocked?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
What?
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
There's another choice.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Do you know what she did to her?
Because I didn't know... 
You just said...
Nothing...
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
And what has that to do with it?
No, it reminds me.
I'd love one.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
I'd like to begin.
No.
How  ?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
I didn't guess until it was too late.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
And the baby.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Oh.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Do I snore?
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
He hasn't.
Sorry.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
What are you?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Books are good!
Parading's better!
Parading?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
What?
Every morning.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Yeah ... so what?
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Come on speedy!
You've got a midnight matinee.
I'm not, no.
Oh you do, look.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Temper! Temper!
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Aren't we ...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
Is that you, Roby?
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
I'll see what I can do.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, you'll follow me.
What's up?
God I'm hungry.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
What do you mean?
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
I hope not.
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
It wouldn't come.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
It's time for drastic remedies.
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Can you get them back?
No.
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
We can use the flamethrower.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Anything else?
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
But why draw it on the wall?
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Is that its mouth?
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Where are you?
You win.
Go ahead, Jay.
What's that supposed to mean?
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
Here, carry these.
No... don't...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
It's on the board.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Force the door.
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Take a look at this.
That's a fact.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Yeah, I...
Auto-shop?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Phoebe?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Yes. I do.
You take charge.
Just some coffee.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Paved with what, then?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Lloyd and I.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
You sat and talked until it was light...
I never intended you to be.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Margo? Lunching in public?
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
How nice.
Right here. A minute ago.
Show me a human and I might have!
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
That never stopped you before.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
For instance - you!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Is it the money?
Every day.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
What have I got to do with it?
- and for you.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
Oh, brother.
See you home...
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
What report? To whom?
Try...
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
You won't forget it?
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
But the raves about your performance-
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
I've got it.
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
I'm so happy you're happy.
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
What about Bill?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Isn't that what they always say?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
Margo!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I don't think I could be.
I just played it.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
A couple of weeks.
All you got to do is name it.
I promise.
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
The fucking New York Times.
--see?--
Facts or theory?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--Colson.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
How high up, which Republicans?
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
If he self-destructed.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
Night.
Whatever.
Any idea what he did?
On the orders of Haldeman?
Can't help you.
--yes--
--Deep Throat?--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
No games, Irwin; give.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Electronic surveillance.
I have nothing more to say.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
--yes, yes, what is it?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Howard--
Absolutely.
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
The what to what?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Like what?
Charming.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
You mean...and orgasm?
No you haven't.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Are you kidding?  No.
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
You can crash at Stifler's?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Just in time.
Yeah.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Um...okay...
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
That's my trick!
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
You want to do it?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Okay.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
I don't care.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Yep.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
What?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
And who's Claude?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
It's okay. I can see fine.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
A la votre.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
What?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Sure. Don't you?
What?!
What about me?
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
Why the fuck would I do that?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Claude.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
I'm not sure but look. . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Come out! I can do alterations.
I shant!
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Who are you?!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
I have my reasons.
Why?
You are the Princess.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
I cursed then all!
He's her?
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
Are you feeling all right?
No. Empress, you --
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
What's your name?
All the good meetings are taken.
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Yes.
Why not?
Do you feel all right?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Lyndon Johnson?
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Well, stop listening to him.
How can you possibly oversleep?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Get him!
Hey, that was last year.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Nice car.
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
Oh.
Your grammy!
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Neat, yeah.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
It's terrific.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
H'm?
No.  You're a wreck.
What? What?
M'hm.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm not.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
What... huh?
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
Are you?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Key word here is "indulgent."
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
You're crazy!
Right, Max. California, Max.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Yeah. Right.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Yeah.
Did you know the contractor?
It's the way they do things.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
What?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
October-ish.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
What what's about?
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Oh.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
And you're not the wife.
Sally?
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
Probably not.
Fantastic.  Out here.
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Just do what I say, alright?
Through the sweats or not?
I'll say as little as possible.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Truce.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It's not like this all the time.
About me!
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I wanted you back.
I don't want to go tonight.
Will you make love with me?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Don't be silly.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
You're an interior decorator, right?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Lemon it is.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Not good.
I'm sure you understand.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Oh?
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Yeah.
Not enough.
Like the last time.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
What does that mean?
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Um.  Happy for you.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Hm.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
Oh Soph...
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well...  I declared war!
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Wait, I hear something!
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
So...you two are in love?
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Something the matter?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
No.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How come?
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Cheers.
You're so right.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
You don't want me here --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Miss. 
Something wrong with your legs?
They had to pump it out.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
You don't have to entertain me.
Give what up?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
For me?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
In this house, you're supposed to.
That's terrible.
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Might as well go all the way.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Mind if I come in?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What for?
Gas?
I don't know.
Are you going to deny it?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Mine?
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
What does he mean, accident?
Who else?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Sure, Doc.
Well, I have things to do --
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Happy New Year.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
The party's over.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Let me take that.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Handle what?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Yeah, we better.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
What gives?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Where are you headed?
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Sure, thanks.
Delta ?
We do.
A long time.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
I don't know.
I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Let's go.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Shot himself. What for ?
All right I got a little surprise for you --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
While you were sleeping.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Listen.
Looks pretty shallow.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Touchy.
This gentleman or myself ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Maybe.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.
Six to eight feet.
What's the furthest you been in?
What'd you do for supplies?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
I love it.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Yes...
Were you with him, when...
Which one's the Colonel's?
Sure.
You're Australian?
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Cognac?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
Yes.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
I do.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
23   CONTINUED:  
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Back against the bars.  Now.
Had?
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Wait a second.
What's going on?
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
It's a spring day...
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Shut up!
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What does this matter to you?
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Where's the kid?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
Okay.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Yes.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Lovely.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
My son.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Can we order first?
Fries.
One baked -- one fries.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
I should've danced with you.
Were you asleep?
Were you asleep?
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
You know what? I...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
How to die, mostly.
Yes.  No.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
About a dog.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Oh, is he dead?
What's he look like?
Okay, then.
Yeah...
Another place where?
What are you talking about?
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Bullshit.
What?  What's okay?
Oh, yeah.
Why don't you tell me.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Now you understand why I'm here.
Another contractor.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Why didn't you finish this game?
Why?
You were like a boy genius?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Why?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.
Did it ever bother you?
I don't know.
Why not?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
Here?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
What?
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Why?
Did you --
Was she the only one?
Is this becoming complicated?
Why?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
I hope not.
It's a common question.
A dime.
Taken.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
That's exactly what I told myself.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
What do other guys do?
American currency.
I have all day.
Fifteen crowns.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
So?
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
Well, don't get carried away.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Like helping a sick kid?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Tell me some bad news?
Good, what's his number?
Sure I'm sure!
That's my mum's.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
No!
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
We should be done by the weekend.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Yeah, maybe.
What?
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Not this time, Kat.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Yep, it's all yours.
Ah, so what?
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
What for?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
How do I know what's being said?
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
Guests.
Sometimes.
Uh-huh!
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
You will wish you hadn't.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Working....Under cover.
Just yesterday.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Go to hell!
Yes, if you can get him free.
You are quite sure it's secure?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Some Americans?
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
You're fine like that, Mom.
You sleeping with her?
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Why?
Good thing.
Go for it.
Know so.
Yeah.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
Then maybe you can read mine.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Hoped for it.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
No.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
That won't be possible.
So talk to us about something.
How -- how long does she have?
Praying.
I need to be with her.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Where's your old man?
This is 1952....?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Seventeen.
Oh yeah.
And where am I gonna be?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Oh, right, right... 
Is Shemp all right?
Sure, he agreed quickly.
You know me?
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
A mall?
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
The power converter...
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Curious... Very curious....
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Jesus!
Perfect...
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Can't afford to take chances.
I'll catch up with you.
He never bit me.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Good luck to you.
What'd you come out here for?
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
How's he doing?
Positive?
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
No.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Yeah.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Git.
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
What?
Vanished. Thin air.
First thing I did.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
To get my guns.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Everybody okay up here?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
I have a radio fix...
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Bet I do.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
No, no –
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Chet!
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
I...
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Well not much.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash – strike that, a lot of cash.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Well, I can tell you some stories –
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
What do you mean?
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
We gotta call the police –
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
...Yes, thank you.
I apologize, Barton.
Congratulations.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Nine days – Tuesday –
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
...Fred...
How's about it, Bart?
We got a treatment on it yet?
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
About a year and a half.
Are you arresting me?
Yes, you do.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
No.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
No thanks.
Really.  What are you writing about.
How did it end?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
I hope I helped you out.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
Say what?
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
We bring her in for questioning.
She killed him.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
On what basis?
Only if you're making it.
When's your show?
Let's get out of here.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
Saddle River, New York!
Who?
I can get ten.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Really?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
I think I could do that alone.
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
You don't have any fucking money..
A present I picked up for you.
What's that about?
It's three thousand dollars!
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar – I'll get the rest.
Stand still.
A what?
I need this?
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I'm -- sorry, I --
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Photojournalist.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
No.  No glass on the inside.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Dad!  Save yourself!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Too late for what, dear child?
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Can I get some help over here?
What?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
I find that unlikely.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
What do you mean?
Then you never loved me?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Hardly a worry, sir.
It'll never work.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
There's one other thing. I feel..
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Wait. You can't go.
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
What? This isn't normal?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
What?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
I don't want to remember!
...Not the bat?
Absolutely not.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
You sunk my battleship.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
... Murderer...
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
... Terror.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I wish you'd...
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Finding out where she is.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
That's it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Holy shit...
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Are they paying you for all this?
Great. How??
There aren't hotels?
I said I'd check with you.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
A car sounds sensible.
Sean Connery.
Sure did.
Yes?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
The TV.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Uh... Uh...
Huh huh huh.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Huh? Huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Butt-snatch...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Oh, that's nice.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam!
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
<u>You</u> left me.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Maybe we should knock first?
But <u>we</u> let him out.
What makes you think she likes me?
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Oh puh-leeze!
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
No.  What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
No.  You don't want his help.
We're practicing.
They're dead.
Where'd they go?
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Yes.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.

There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Stepmother's...
... sheets.
I cannot believe this.
Delia will cook...
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I see.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
In a day or two, yes.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Yes, sir.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
Ben is very ill.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
I understand.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
I like to watch.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Good day, Sally.
... Yes. You can take me.
I see.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I am a very serious gardener.
I see...
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Oh, really...
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
... In the garden?
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Do you need a secretary?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
That's good... That's good.
Right, Chief.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
I would appreciate that.
Oh? What?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Malkovich!
Who am I thinking of?
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Enjoy.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
I... puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Just an idea I had.
The iguana.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
Let me try.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Yes?
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Emily Dickinson.
No, really.
My tits?
You're a fag or a liar.
Please, let me explain.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Good morning, Lotte!
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
No you mustn't, my child.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
When?
No.
Mr. Malkovich?
Whatever you're having.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Lotte called me.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Was a time I knew what was.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
Don't pay to complain.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am.
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Could be that fall you took.
Won't you be late for work?
Morning, ma'am.
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
True.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
It's her, ain't it?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
He knew Baby Suggs?
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
For what?
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
I don't want to know.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Why me, man?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
But I guess she told Dieter.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Where's your car, Dude?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Are these.
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
"Johnson"?
You mean coitus?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Take a look at this, sir.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Well...yeah--
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Uh-huh.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Am I wrong!
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Huh?
Huh?
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
We throw the money out of the moving car!
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
But Walter--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Nihilists!  Jesus.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
The bulk of the series.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
And the fucking money!
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Uh-huh.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
Did I urinate on your rug?
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Bunny.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well we--I don't--
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
What?
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
I don't understand.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Too bad you're out of it.
He was here.  Watching us.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
I don't buy it.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Pass.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
It worked, didn't it?
Preventive medicine.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
Graffiti --
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Some. It's been slow --
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
Deacon brought me back.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
You don't have to be.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Mrs. Leavitt--
Christ.
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
You don't want it though.
--scared the living shit out of us.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
No fucking.
Try a long walk.
What're you doing with all this shit?
--who?
The wheel.
--turn the camera off--
I'm not finished.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
What're you nuts--
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
What?
Get some more beer.
--I know!
I'm sorry.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
--fuck Anna!
Why?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
No.
I am?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
In the trunk.
Thanks.
About ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
...Friday?
Uh-huh.
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
You're an idiot.
Yeah...
Nobody knows you hired me?
Has Ray come in yet?
Red Label.
Meurice...
Thanks Meurice.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah. I get it.
No. not at all.
Hello, daddy.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Jeffrey nothing.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
No.
Lie down on the bed.
No. What is happening?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Yes. Frank-
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
What do you want?
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
What kinda beer do you like?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What else is new?. right?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Yeah. Good bye.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Yes. I do.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
O.K.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
You didn't tell him about me?
Where to?
Go ahead.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Yeah?
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
That sounds great!
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
What?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
You happy, baby?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Excuse me?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
We want some grass.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
No?
No, my brother.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Oh my G-d.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Just a friend.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
What?
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about.
Sure.
And Diego?
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I'm going to California.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
That was a beautiful message.
What do you guys want?
What about him?
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Tuna.
Do I know you?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
What is your name?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
What's happening to us?
Are we gonna split up?
Well, here I am.  See?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Yeah.
California, huh?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
No. It has failed in its objective.
Second district ...
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Yes ... But let me first see you.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
But there's more?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
You've been following me?
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Can you give the court an example?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
She was.
What did she say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
No.
No.  No, I don't.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
What did you prescribe for her?
No.
Where did you meet him?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Then you would have gotten your money?
You know I can't talk about that.
No further questions.
We're not animals.
Why not?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Yes -- she did.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Really?
She's mistaken.
Of course.
Are you scared?
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
You're a monster.
That wasn't the deal.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
She's waiting in the conference room.
-- But it's Sunday.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Where have you been?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
No.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
No.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
'82.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Carolyn!
Oh, yes.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Yeah.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Clean?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
Then what happened?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
I would love to come for dinner.
Yeah. See you later.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Yes, that'd be nice.
I bet you could do a book.
What?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
How do you know what I experience?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
Nah.
Cremated?!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Just some flies.
What the hell you talking about?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Go for it.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
We met.
I have to finish this for class.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Please.  It's for your own good.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
The dead get out?
I can't!
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
From what?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
Yeah, you heard of him?
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Potential toxic dump site.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Should I?
Moe's terms.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
You don't need a key.
Where is it?
The money!
Where is it?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
Stay away!
What are you, drunk?
It's impossible!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
Violet, I won't let you leave.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
Where, then?
Shut up!
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Why?
Okay, sure, Mick.
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
You did the right thing.
Yeah.
I knew it.
My pleasure.
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
How did you meet him?
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I don't understand - ?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
I think ...
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Sweet Jesus.
He does it right in front of him.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
No.
...  Me neither.
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
This doesn't go upstairs.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Yes.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
Jason...  They can't let you go...
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Yes, I'm here...
Who?  Who came?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.

Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Get the fuck away from my car.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
I trusted you.
-- we'll tell them what happened --
It's a company... MPG Capital.
Nykwana Wombosi.

xxxxxx
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
So now you're asking for a student visa?
That's the only angle.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
No.
I won't forget this.
... have a look.
... get to it.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What do I have to do.
You must save the day.
You don't have to sing it.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
Triplets.
Really? - God, how time flies!
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Not really, no.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Tell me about Layton.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
So what are you going to do about her?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
They weren't at school with us.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
What?
Them?
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
What parcel?
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Who is this war against, Sam?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Get away!
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Don't do anything silly.
It's not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
But if they did promote you
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Yes.
What?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
You're not listening, mother.
What is it?
It's something for executives.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
This is an emergency!
No need, sir
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
What do they want you or?
No underwear?
He looks like a cop.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Sure, sure, give go.
John, play the Sinatra.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
He's dead, huh?
No.
How is she?
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
He's better, though, right?
Not as good as Nino's.
You asked me not to come.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
What look?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
That's ridiculous.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Oh, stop it.
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Okay.
Yes.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Why do you say that?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Of course.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
As good as humanly possible.
Yes.
No.
Then what was good about it?
This is important to me.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I'll never tell.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Anchor?
I'll speak to you.
Honey?...
You don't have to finish tonight.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
I like "godsend."
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
Uh-huh.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Okay.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Were you going to you?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Okay.  Good night.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Um...
You're breaking my concentration!
What!
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Honest?
Let's see it.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Better!
Yes Walter.
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Good night Walter.
You didn't mean to what?
Yeah and what would I say?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Hm.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Relax!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Yes, get rid of them...
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
What do you get?
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Shut up!  You let him have it!
I had him in my grasp.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
I'm fine.
Get away from here.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Down there.
Eeyuu.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Nothing.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I'll back that up.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
Dress, huh?  What for?
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Please.  It's so '91.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
To bring you... your birthright.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Why do you keep saying that?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Here?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
I had to test you.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Same one.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
They don't even have Dolby.
Good enough!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
Well, I hope so.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You said "Crash".
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
God, I never thought of that.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
it's okay..
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
That's great!
We all deserve to wear white.
No.  Please.
He won't make love to me anymore.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
No.
Yeah...you a witch?
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
If you believe in Voodoo.
You spit on me!
Beg me again!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Gimme that.
You been in the Majors?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Don't try me.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
The worst was Blue.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Please...
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
And what'd she want?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Okay. 
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Why're you crying?
You're with me now.
Right?
You sure?
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Okay?
All right...
Yeah.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Fuck you!
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
Oh...
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I should have -
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You get down here!
I'm not -
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
Ye-yeah.
Yeah.
Shut your mouth!
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Okay.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Calm down! Calm down!
For what?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
What're you gonna do?
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
Mm.
Mm.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Yeah.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Hm.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
You fucked with me for the last time!
But I saw something...
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
You jag-off.
I took care of everybody.
But he never talked.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah.
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Having a good time?
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
You're probably right.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
We'll hunt him down together...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Why am I still troubled...
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
And...your point?
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
Oh now this one is mine...
You turned around!
What?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Don't you have children?
Did you have to tell her my name?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Why would I do that?
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
It's taken care of.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Don't lay this on me!
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
A woman?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
The one in Brentwood.
Black Mercedes, 600S.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
What's going on?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
They put their hands all over me.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
I don't want it.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
You mustn't hang up.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
You should've done all this before.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Call me "Nels."
There's two police cars now.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
How do you know?
I thought so.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
He's what she should run a mile from.
See what, Dil?
Nice.
I would expect he does.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Who the fuck is he?
Guy I work with.
The accent, I suppose.
They all get the wrong idea.
You can't leave me then, can you?
What look?
How different?
Tell me about him.
Didn't think I could.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
Aha.
Give it over, Dil --
Must be.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Probably.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
More than that.
You'd do anything for me?
I promise.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Yes.
Prescription. For my condition.
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Died...
Did you hear me?
I like you, DIl
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Yes. Say hello to Col --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Need to go across the water.
Did you give him it?
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
I know.
Perfect.
I take pride in my work.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Fuck you, too --
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What is it now?
Why can't we?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Ever see hurling?
Best game in the world.
I'll bear that in mind.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
What?
I don't know her.
I'm sorry.
How can I?
No.
What?
You didn't?
It's lovely.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Open up.
Why?
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Reggie -- listen to me --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
That's not Carson Dyle.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh. 
Yes, I know.
The shower's in there.
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
Go on.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
I'm very cold.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I don't know.
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Did you?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Charles is.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
A quarter of a million dollars.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
So they think he left it with you.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Don't put yourself out.
Good night.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Please stop -- please!
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't you want me to stay?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
I've never seen him before.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
So?
is there anything you do?
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
You're grounded Friday night!
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
You never went, uh, all the way?
Are you sure?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
St. Michael's.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Really?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
FINE. Are you?
No.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
You heard about that?
Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
You Miss Dunlop?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
What?
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Did he say anything else about her?
Who was the fourth?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
NO!
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
I'm worried about someone.
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT.
Oh...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...-tana.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
I got, like, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
All right, then how about this?
...doing?!
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
Are you kiddin'?
...all the time.
...-ed.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Okay, okay! 
Doesn't work.

  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
 Okay.
Come on, old Pete.
I know the likeli-...
...wanna give it a try!
I made it!
 Gee, you think so?

 Go on.

Come on.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
I'm a dangerous man!
...man!
He's crazy!
I'm crazy?
Okay.
...truck.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
We got two paddles.
...or my conscience.
Huh?
Arlo, shut up.
What?
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 
Go, go, go! 
...to him. 
You got Elvis?!
Okay.
We've got Elvis!
Tunnel.
I'm gonna kill him.
 What's it say? 
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Us.  Owes us.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Thank you.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Vaughn.
So...where's my truck?
Mason, you have to take this...

 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
...-bility.
You'll kill us all!
"Went away."  I like that.
So far, ye-yes.
...happen if I drop this?
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...here!
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
Radio the bikes.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Check it out.
Check the immediate area.
Prep the launcher now.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Sir.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...the river.


...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
And don't give him any ice cream...
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
What's going on, colonel?
All right.  Enough. Look...
I will tell you what I...
...colonel?
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
He's brains without ambition...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
 No...
...-m-means, Mason.  
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
We've got the real thing!
Yeah.
 Pappas!  Move the car!


I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Do you know him?
Where from?
None.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
When was the last time?
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Off the alley.
The apple core club.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
You accusing me of extortion?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
I said I'll drop it.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
Did he know?
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Over the water department, or over you?
Never forgave him for what?
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
What dam?
The Valley?
And Hollis knew about it?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
Get in the car.
Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
Doing what?
They do in Chinatown.
Yeah.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
What about it?
Just... I have to.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Then let's go talk to her.
You're insane.
I will if you don't.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
I'm all right.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
A Miss Sessions calling.
There's just one question.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
And Mulwray isn't?
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Have we ever met?
Never.
What about the water?
That's a long fall.
The L.A. River?
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
Yeah.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
No, you have a press agent do it.
I'm working for his daughter.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
What's she like? What's she like?...
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
OK...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Ask them to sit down.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Of course.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
In the water.
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
Thanks.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You really don't know who I am?
Oh, me -
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Susan, I really think -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Thanks.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Yes, sir. 
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Why, Brad?
She was going to leave you anyway -
Brad, you are drunk.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Rawlston is my boss.
Was he in love?
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I'll have a highball.
Rosebud?
Are you serious?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I think you'd better leave now.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
Just now.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No.
How like her.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
I'm just kidding.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
With this guy locked in?
Yes.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Lenin's Tomb.
That's what I said.
No, thanks.
Seven months.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
What do you mean?
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
I think it's safe to say yes.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
All right, Vader's boss...
How do you mean?
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
She's in here?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Let's hear it.
Can you believe this?!
I know.
I don't back down.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
If you go, I go.
You know.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Exactly.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I don't; you did.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
You're a snake.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Thanks.
Jesus.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What time did you get to work today?
Thirty-fire.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Excuse me?
They are not.
I... I don't believe this...
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
You!
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Sure.
It was only a few times...
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Veronica, I love you...
What?
Can I have your name please?
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
Well, how about these two movies? 
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Screw you!
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
I will. Take it easy.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
So, what do you see?
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Would you?
Is it really four thousand?
That's it, you look like a professional.
Three...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
You can stop right there.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
Resuscitation?
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Where?
Hal knows what he's doing.
He can handle it.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Call me sentimental.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
"Time is money" -- please.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Forget it!  I refuse!
What the hell's going on?
Tucker and Walker.
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Then it's a deal.
Do you always transport through the air?
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Let's move your ass in there!!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
No, brother. What d'you want?
I'm gonna be sick.
C of E, sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Lice?
We're going to friends now, sir.
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
And when do I get out of here then?
Indeed.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
It's no big deal.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Max, the cab driver!
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
What thing?
I never bought that.
Elvis?
...if they're wrong?!
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Of course!
What am I gonna do with flowers?
What's he sayin'?
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
You prefer nights?
You on some kind of work plan?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Who was he?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
You mind?  I'm working here.
Leave me alone.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Dmitri?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
Why?
Paid sick leave?
Head towards Union Station.
One more.
And you believe me...?
Then what are you?
Answer the question.
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
The guy came right at us!
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Six months.  Eleven days.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Who?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
You watch me, don't you?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Right here in Manhattan.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Jerry, I --
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Where are we going, Jerry?
Did you kill my father?
I don't understand.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
I can't promise you anything.
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You've never seen her run.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
You've asked me that one three times.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Please, sit.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
I don't understand.
Working.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Wait --
Yeah, I do.
Where do you think Jerry is?
There's no plug to pull.
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You know why I'm here.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Ellie --
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
This is how you see the sky?
Is that your official response?
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Can you help us?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
It's so... small.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Mmm.  Look closer.
-- of Hadden Industries.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
That's what they all say.
We could be together again --
But the work --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Spoken like a true believer.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
In other words.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
Oh.  I brought you something.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
She took off with that convertible feller...
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta go, Arletta.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Tramp! Beautiful!
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Kick a buck.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
I want to die.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
But </u>alive</u>!
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
He was lying.
What pattern was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I don't have it...
You already made the delivery?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
You come and visit.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Who was the man in the basement?
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Because I'm all you've got.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
Michael Johnson.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Shut up.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
And her husband? What was he?
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Yeah, and a dimple.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
You look beautiful.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Ecru.
Mom, please.
Letty.
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
What if it's got a pattern?
I've already checked it out 17 times.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Your family just met me.
But I do.     I love you, too.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
It's sex time.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
Always the drugs.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
I guess so.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What do you want to do?
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
You just need to get more organized. L
Sure. Why?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Yes, I suppose so.
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
I start on Monday.
What?
I'm really sorry.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Where are the tapes?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Oui.
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
He missed three weeks.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
Half the tapes.
I know they won't be home tonight.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
We have to find Sophie.
Has to be.
No?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
You haven't answered my question.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I will.
Man, I can get anything.
I've got a way with people.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Everything.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
You can use my car.
I see.   A master criminal.
Relax. It will be fine.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
Yeah.   It's mine.
How?
Tonight.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
It's not your fault.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
Okay.    Okay.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
I'm just playing around.
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
Don't bother.
So what if I don't?
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
How so?
I'm bored.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
They forced me to marry!
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Kneel!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
Let them look.
Jen...
Fine.
Yes.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
But Wudan does not accept women.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
This is a delicate matter.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
No onions?
Annie, I need a file.
No further.  I'm serious.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
It's only a flesh wound.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
I lost my key.
It can't rain all the time.
Mister Funboy lives there?
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I don't know you...
Take the dope, too.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
T-Bird?
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Yes.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Kill a dead guy?
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
What do you mean?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Why not?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Great book.
You implied it.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
No thank you.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
And you promise to abide by it?
Reading.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Fine.
Hi.
I'm sorry about that.
Any ideas who it could be?
Okay.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
No.
You'd do that for me?
Best friends.
What do you mean?!
What do I do then?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
That's one way of looking at it.
Cool.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Is it me?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
It works a little.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Likewise I'm sure.
Yeah?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
Any day now.
I'm aware.
Take a look for yourself.
So what went wrong?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I want to fuck.
I've never done this before.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Annette?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Get out!
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
She's out.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
On the back street — a green house
Do you know the people?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Times have changed.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
But...
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But you must!
Of course,
You wanted to share this moment with me.
But she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
That's the clever way to do it.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
But I only came to give back the ring.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
No, thank you.
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
My daughter died long ago.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
I like to see her happy.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
I've changed a lot lately.
At Victoria's Secret.
What else is there?
What does that have to do with me?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
Maybe he's just shy.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Frida, grab that red one.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Peter keeps asking me out.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You don't have to pee.
So pee? Here?
Yeah right... You better go.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
Are you following me?
Oh, it's nothing.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
My period? No.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Okay.
No, take it.
How big?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Tell her I'm eating.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
I see...
Yes, sir.
Put it through...
What?  Who has?
What is going on?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
Great.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
... What?
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Are you threatening me?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
The government
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
So what do we do?
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Wrong...
Does it make the cars any better?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
I can't say.
Oh.
No.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You're kidding.
No... They don't kid.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
I don't understand.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Thanks.
Oh... Okay.
It's just so strange...
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
It's nice.
I know.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Fabulous.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Then why did you come here?
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Well?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
I'll tell you later.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
I'm not?
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
You know,
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Good luck.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Todd Anderson.
I... I just don't want to come.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
And now he will?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
I guess.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
From my father and Nolan.
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Quite a few.
Right... You have a boat.
How do you know that?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
I'm stuck...
A little to the left...
I have been.
You want some too?
What the hell does that mean?
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
What?
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
It's gotta!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Sure. Why not.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
You are frightened, no?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Linda, yeah.
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
No?
Worse since she talked to him.
Biederman, yes.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
No.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
What?
I don't know.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
I want to go home, Merle.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
Pow.
Yeah.
It's ahead, Vince.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you mean?
We what?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Listen, Nick --
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Where?
Merle gave me this?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
The fuck I did!!!
Down ribbon!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
Aces.
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
Doucet killed my partner.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
How ya feeling?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
No you don't.
No -- that's for me to do.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
What Grange?
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Belle --
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Some other time, Stevens.
Where's everybody?
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
I do -- and I think you should too.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
What -- what's on your mind?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
We can still use my butter money.
Mary -- what would you do?
I don't know, Jabez.
All right, Jabez ...
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Why don't you?
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
So, you divorced of what?
So, why didn't you come?
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
The police...?
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Tell me about it.
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Only if New Jersey counts.
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Then don't waste time talking to me.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
I'm here, cowboy.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
Yeah.  It was terrible.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
I don't know what I'm doing.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Yeah.
Yeah... yeah!
That's good then.  You've found something.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
My side, shit!
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I don't fool around with you.
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
I used to, but I stopped.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Yes...
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
How'd that happen?
But do you mean it?
What kind of a deal?

Wyoming.
Yeah ...
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
Did Pop come down?
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Top of the World at the Stratosphere. It's completely secure. <b> INT. FBI JET -- NEXT </b> Cosgrove and Espinoza listen to this conversation.
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
I don't know. They might be dead already.
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
Yes.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
That's the rumor on the street.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
He said... take his right arm.
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Is that the only tape you got?
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
So?
What?
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
I don't know how he does it.
Is it a good morning?
I didn't.
Ten.
What makes Sammy run?
I'm in here.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
I'm getting paid...
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
I'll do.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
It's dug.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Yes you did.
Tonight, when we close.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Do we now?
Quit bullshitting.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
No.  What are you gonna do?
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Shit!  I forgot.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Later.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
You get paid to do what we say.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Tell Vito.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Excuse me.
Depends how you define 'new'...
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
O'clock?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
So boys, how was your first day?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Me too!
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Will not.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
They can't be real.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Yea!
I don't think so.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY!
Captain Rob came back?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
The answer is George Jefferson.
No. What happened?
Are, too.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Oh I think you do.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
You were born free and free you should remain.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
What the hell are you talking about?
Yes you are. 
But we don't drink from the house do we.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
The evidence of what?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Yes.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Don't you trust your own eyes.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
I can't... I can't.
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
I am always on time.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Rolling.
This is the big moment...!
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I guessed.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Raising money is tough.
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I think you're quite handsome.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
How long's he been here?
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Bela died.
The sun.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
I'm directing.
Wow.
No! Do they show you having sex?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
Went --
I'm moving out.
What?
This is real, Bananahead!
So?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Uh-huh?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Ed --
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Are the TV people with you?
Hey, he cheated on her.
No! And that girl has a name.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
No.
What is she, at work?
Well, when will she be back?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our what?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Dynamite.
Yeah.
What?
No. Who?
What do we have to do?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Yeah?!
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh, man! So...
What is? Oh, dinner!
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Do it!
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
You're kidding, right?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Right
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Why are you doing this?
Take as much room as you want
You'll be fine.
You will.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
And how did you get in the school?
Sure.
Still clear?
Right now?
You're there.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
I also like bananas.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
I'm not like you.
I know.
Well, I do.
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Thanks!
Sure, Tracy.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Call me Dudley.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Homicide?  A detective?
You've got it, Wendell.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Get the fuck away from me.
She told you?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
<u>Lynn</u>.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Against your code?
More's gonna cost you.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Until he gunned down six people.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Why?
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Not even with Exley?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Yeah.  My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Decorated?
Bud White's been here?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Not good enough.
I'll take your word for it.
You, me and White, huh?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Do you have any proof?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Is she?
And Reynolds?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
Working whores with squad two.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
You're not.
Who else have you told?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
A direct one.
Wait.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I was a traffic analyst.
How'd you have the manpower to--
What's going on?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
You sure?
Those are Feds.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
What if <u>what</u>?
Not particularly, no.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
Pardon?
For that matter, I think you will too.
That's my point.
About what?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Not a very good one, but--
You should take this seriously.
Something bad happened tonight.
I saw a man die.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
How could you let me find out like this?
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
What happened to your head?
My suitcase is gone.
I don't believe it is, no.
It's not?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
Why?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
That's temporary.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Fuck off.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
They're framing me.
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah, what's going on?
I honestly don't know.
You would?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
There was a transfer.
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
No thank you.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Yes sir.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
What do you mean, poetry?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
No.
Oh my God, the others!
Now.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
You will.  You will.
No.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
There you have me.
Sorry, what's your point?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Bermann!
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Okay.
No.
Don't cut me.
Very true!
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Right.
What?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
How?  How can you see anything?
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
Why?  Is he staying?
Would you like me to?
Hana, I know you do!
Thank you.
You get Hardy.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
Yes.  Later.
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Then come with me.
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
No.  He's - no.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
How awful.  What will you do?
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
You got a better idea?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Which you have in mind.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
How close?
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
No you can't.
How about if you try disappearing.
I don't want to waste your time.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I sincerely hope so.
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
It's not for sale.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Where's my bag?
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Nice spot.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
It was a long time ago.
A dozen times.
Charged. Receiver?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.
I've got something for you.
Something like that.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
Ready.
Shut up.
Yes. Yes.
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Everything.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Parachute.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
The disc is still in there.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
You can do it.
You are a miracle worker.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
To yourself, that's where.
Thought you had to use some of these.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Five million dollars?
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
That's crazy -- why not?
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
They skipped that step.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
You're not gonna be there.
Why not?
Say you were wrong.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
So did I.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
Which number do you want, George?
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I'm just saying --
I will.  Bye.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks and growls at his boss.
What happened?
Barks his agreement.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
I'm going to see what it is.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
And what are they, pray tell?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Probably an asteroid field ....
I take it back.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
That should do nicely.
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
You look great.
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
This ought to be good.
I understand.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
A display of primitive apparatus --
I don't believe it.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
We'll see.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
It's history. I gotta go.
Does he know how to activate it?
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Looking to get out.
Down that way.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Sewers. Come on.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Speak of the devil!...
That's not why you came.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
...to ride out and meet them.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
Ye...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
And you cannot love me...
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Maybe... maybe...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Fuck it.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I didn't know that.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Phonograph.
All right then we've got clean rats.
I just heard them Karl.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
What man?
And those lies she's been telling?
Convulsion?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
On what?
You wouldn't.
You could do it yourself...
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
No, is Regan aware of it?
What do you drink?
It's fine really, sit.
Have you told him what's happening?
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Oh, Christ.
You just missed them.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Ego te abslovo.
La plume de ma tante.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
There's only one.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Amen
Can you give her something?
What's this about?
I once did a paper on it
From the psychiatric end.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Unlikely.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Be silent!
...from this creature of God!!!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Is it Captain Howdy?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
No.
Recognize these two characters?
That's not the point.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Thanks.
Seeing anyone in particular?
It's more than that.
What?
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Get out of here!
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
Yeah.  Something.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Two years ago.  March.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
A few bars!
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
We're gonna be here a week?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Really.
Time flies, huh?
She's a big girl.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
How come I didn't hear anything?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
He was just having fun.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
Better give her pneumonia.
Twenty-eight years.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
What?
Shut up, Frank.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Five years ago.  November.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
All right.
All right.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Hey.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Forget it.
Uh, well ...
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Right.  In there.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
Yeah.
And you don't?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
I guess in case one year they're not.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
Nervous?
Look, if you want to leave...
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
I didn't want to wake you.
Eddie did.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Why not?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Ever go to church?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Yeah -- me.
My place.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
We need to talk.
It's important.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Don't hang up ...
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Would it?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Not anymore.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Get rid of them.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Just following your example.
What's that?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I'm not going anywhere.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Great.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
That’s right. And auto supply...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Bye...
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Ah. A classic...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Hey...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Me?
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Basically, it’s my car now.  Get in.
Give me my goddamn life back!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
It’s lovely...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids’ recital.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
What...?
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
I think it may help us but there’s a slight chance it could make things worse.
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
What are you talking about, Jack?
Paris?
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Don’t get on that plane!
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
And God love you for it.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Where is he?
Do I know you?
Hey, are you okay?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
<u>Now</u>.
So are you!
Not this again --
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Then what is it?
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Passion.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Excuse me?
And reverse the mutations --
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Medical's ready.
It's only for an hour --
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
I -- I want to say...
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You may learn to like it.
What gives you that idea?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
What's that?
Oxygenation...
No, there's no other way.
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
That makes two of us.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Look at those Walls up ahead!
What do you mean?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
May I have your ticket, please?
No.
Whoa, Daddy.
Jezhush.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
Oh, yah, I know that!
Yah, right-o.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Ya got that right.
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Hold on.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No, I -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
2:30.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
No way.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Gotta go?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
No, no, that's fine.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
I'm sorry.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Copy.
There's the car! There's the car!
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
It's terrific!
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
We're still men.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Yeah, both of us.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
Yes?
I'll ask the questions, son.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Sure.
Yeah.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
Here.
Whatever.
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
... You know me?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
Pardon me?
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Being clever.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
No, I...
Would that be a problem?
Can I stay at your place?
What's that?
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
Like hell.  That counted.
The fight.
I know that.
Same here.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
Doesn't matter.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
You know what I mean.
Look...
I want to know --
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
Tyler...
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
What?
Wait a minute...
"Training?"  Tyler...
What's this all about, Tyler?
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
Green?  Did you say green?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
You need me.
What?
Excuse me?
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Yes, it is.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Please, God, no...
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
I...I...
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
She had the baby?
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
Take my van!
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I wasn't worried about us.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Let us out!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Batteries not included.
There are no worse places.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
I suppose you have...
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
Duck soup.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
We just take pictures?
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
American.  Come to get you out.
That's it.  My life.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
I'm paying you.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Most men are.
You still believe in God?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
He's not a moron.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
But..How could that happen?
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Which ones?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
They work for Him.
Him...?
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
I know...
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Sure...
I know!
Fuck you.
Oh...like Moses.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
No, I...
Now, now.
Is what you?
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
I don't, huh?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
No. We have tomatoes.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
I know.
A couple of months.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
No, thanks...
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
I was really very moved by the way you...
Why?
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
That's what you said?
What?
No, the last time was three years ago.
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
You're all full of shit!
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Not at all.
Perhaps...
Look at me.
Not now, I'm busy
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
So get the fuck outta here.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Is it true?
Victor.
Hi.
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Pitt.
Yeah.
Okay, then dance. Show.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Hey!
Yeah.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
You're kidding.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Not luck. They don't want me.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
No idea.
Okay. Some idea.
You don't know me.
Affirmative.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
Where am I?
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
That's it.
Cut the crap and read it.
Harry S. Truman?
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
They busted me last week.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
What's that?
I want you to murder me.
Sure, all drifters do.
Take it where?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Spot right here.
Maybe.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
God...
How come?
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Come here.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I commend him on his choice.
What?
Moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
Uh, almost.
Looks great.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
Print this Frank.
What...
Forget it.
I was upset.
Jim Swarthout?
My secretary.
John!
No, I ain't got you...
Please.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
Thanks, I needed that.
No prob...
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Wha --
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
People still watch that?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Who's my real father, man?
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Shock.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
What?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Man, I'm clean.
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Si tu veux.
Comment va-t-elle?
Who financed it?
Names.
Willie Mays.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Policy man in Queens.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Whatta you got?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
No, I don't.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Nothing.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Huh?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Uh huh...
What's happening?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
What?
October 12, 1969.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
What kinda twisted animal.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Look who's talking.
No.  What house you work?
Sullivan?
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
What?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
What do you mean?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Stop the car!  Now!!
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I just want you to like me.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Did you hear me?!
Are they grown-ups?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Which is?
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
It's...It's all right.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Tell me!
Gotta go.  See you guys later.
Are you crazy?!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
A pizza?!
But she might be in trouble...
Right.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Rennie's not coming.
We have to get off this ship!!
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
He is not.
Really?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
There's something I haven't told you...
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
Where are they?
But Rennie...
I opened thousands of brains.
Ruptured steam pipe.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Elliot?
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
What about the haircut?
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Opening night?
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Brilliantly moving.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
Who the hell cares?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Joanne Bourne.
Alma Wetzel.
She's my gynecologist.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Right here. At the door.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
I can't find it.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
What about my play?
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You know what.
He's a very sweet man.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Never mind.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Well, we shall try.
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
It was one incident.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
From what budget?
Where do we start?
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
Thank you, no.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Suit yourself.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
What <i>is</i> that one?
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
They found my eyelash.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
Why not?
I know about you.
Those checks take forever.
New policy.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Beynon.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Hi.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
Good.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I didn't. I just waited.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I don't want to go there.
Fifteen minutes.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Texas is a big state.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Let's do it.
Twenty eight hundred.
Yeah.
Sure...
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
What about the vault?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Suit yourself.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
'Bout five thousand.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
How?
Who?
What did you do?  Albert?
What did he say?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Go on.
No.
Really?
No. I didn't know that.
You sure about that?
I don't know.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
That must be interesting.
Yeah.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Where would I find him?
Large Scotch.
That's what he was saying about you.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
It'll cost you.
They came back?
Don't ask me.
What you going to do?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
No.
And that'll make me feel better?
Funny, that.
It would be. If they were still living.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Shut up.
Knock it off, Gerald.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
I'm not?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
Mmm...
You did?
I...I don't know.
They came in and they, you know...
...this shit...
It's not right.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
They have...
When they...
How?
Yes.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
For five thousand?
What?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
...and rob the place...
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
That's ridiculous.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
That's...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Down the street.
The cops?
Was I?
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Go to lunch, George.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
Yes.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
I'm not sure I have two.
It's not impossible.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Excuse me...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
What are you talking about?
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
I...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
You did?
Because I don't like you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Shelly...!
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
Kenilw...
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
The monthly interview...?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Kenilworth...?
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
Who did she call?
It's not me, it's my wife.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
What does that mean?
That...
What...?  Say the words.
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
And the check is...
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
Yes.
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
If you don't want it, give it back.
John...
Why do you have to go?
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
Connie.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
The children can stay.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Sure, Mikey.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
They are everywhere!
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Yes.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
No, I'm fine.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Some water.
You want a war?
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
What's to be jealous of?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You liked it too.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
You mean us?
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Expect nothing fancy.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You're sure of that?
Yes!  You know?
We have his note.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
Huh?
Broke is more like it.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
No.  I --
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Better work.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
You were a soldier?
Something happened to him?
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
David produced her last picture.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Oh Clayton.
Good.  Fine.
Then take the pills.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
More your line.
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
Then the rumors are true?
You didn't?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Tell me about Kip -
A boost. A big boost ...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Castlebeck.
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
okay ...
We're partners here --
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
What color?
oh.
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
You've been pre-booked...
Yeah... You want a ride...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
Shadow games ...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
Toby...
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
No problem -
We can't do that, dude --
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
Call 'em here -- ?
Buy you a drink?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
No way ...
Oh. Okay. Right.
I think so... They're just... So ...
I take out my slim-jim...
The alarms go off ...
Now... I'm in ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
How is he -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Tell me...
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
What? What happened?
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Oh I Him.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Liar!
That again.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
I can't do it anymore.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
What did he say, exactly?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
No, and we got four of 'em.
What?
You don't know that.
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
This is your house, right?
Is this a bad time?
Okay.
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
I told you, I just got change.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Yeah, can I help you?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
What're you doing?
--That edge!
I'm pretty sure it's right.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Bullshit.
Yes.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Not at all.
You moved?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--Gerry--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Come in.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Have you read all these books, Will?
Whatever blows your hair back.
Tell me what you really think.
What is?
Watch your mouth.
How'd it go?
Well, are you going out again?
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
So Christ, call her up.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Where were you?
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
What?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
I didn't want the job.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
Good luck.
What?
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
So you just want to use me and go?
No I haven't...
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
Exactly.
It's important that I learn this.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
So, do you play the piano?
I want you to come with me.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Is that what you think--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Oh.
Lots must a died, too.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Women?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Which way is House 25?
How many of you?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
And you ain't ashamed?
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
No. They wasn't people to write.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.
I don't know.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Lookin' for a job?
Get to what?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
No plants.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
What's that--detour?
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
But who done it?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Are you crazy?
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
California, here we come!
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
It's what I do.
--No.
Never better.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Yes.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
You see someone?
It's always the little things.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
What?
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Morality.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Up on the right.
That sounds pretty interesting...
I guess.
He using her.
I get it.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
No. You drove us here.
Mein Dealer.
To shoot you. Correct.
Wow.
How are you? How's business?
How's that?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
All by yourself?
Doesn't matter.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
A jogger, huh?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
I can handle it!
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
How did you meet her?
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
The point was to love each other.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Yeah?
I didn't know I had to.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
No, you just act like you do.
Little.
I didn't see it.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
You're right. Good.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I said... I started.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Riding with Judith.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Oh, how sweet.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
No, not yet.
You just showing off for her!
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Honey... I was always good.
What stuff is that?
What do you mean?
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
It's cool!
Again?  Yeah sure.
I want it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yo, hit the lights.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
We did it!
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
Are you challenging me?
If I win, you become my slave.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Okay sure. What about?
When did you find this out?
What's going on?
No. You son of a bitch!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Yes, sir.
Can't you find somebody else?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
It's okay..it's okay.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I can't sleep.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
You bet.
Yeah, hurry up.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Then we'll be safe?
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't come on too strong.
Where are you going?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Do you?
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Now you understand?
That's not true. Here I am.
Sure.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I have a place for that.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Sure, see you later.
Lies.
He can still watch.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
No, he's not.
I don't want to.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
He isn't a man.
You all right?
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Sure. Sure.
See you.
There is no such thing.
No...
Promise?
You're coming with us...
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I'm wasting time.
Thorazin.
Are you really interested?
Great.
Uh --
Right.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Oh, okay.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
You're out looking here?
Yeah, sure. 
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
What are you doing?!
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
I know it isn't.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Lee...
Aren't they great?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
No!
Are you in love with someone else?
No.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
Yeah.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Absolutely.
Mmm...
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Yes, please.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
You look so beautiful.
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
That's a beauty!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Yeah.
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, can you believe it?
You know.
No!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
It was a terrible evening.
Come on.
No, I am.  I am.
No, the reason I ask is--
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh!
Hi.
Okay.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
...<u>please</u>...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Yes?
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...what a world.
...are you alright, sir...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
What reaction?
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
For a consideration.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
I think its meaning is clear.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
A wonderful country...
Well, perhaps sometime we...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
What is that that smells so wonderful.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
<u>Yes</u>.
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Because...?
The shape of a Three.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Brazilian. 
...no...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
...yes...?
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
That wants to be a Yes.
Why do you even like me?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I just never thought of you in that...
I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
I think your condescension is even better.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Probably.
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
It's not my style, okay?
Hey, don't run away now.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
King David.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
That's good. Have you done this before?
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Did to.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Pretty weird.
Punch it in!
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
That's three things.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
sighs.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
Somebody's got to help us!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
That idiot boarder?
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
The way you just looked at me...
No.
Gwen.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Zero's a number right?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
This isn't happening.
It's perfect.
What?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
What things do you think you've done?
I surrender...
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
Bodybuilding!
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
LaPlante!
You're sitting on your ticket.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And the rent is okay?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
I understand that.
-- a sense of proportion.
A sense of proportion.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Uh huh.
I'm thirsty.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
I've asked him what's wrong.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Did you hear what he said?
What?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
No.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Fuck you, Philip.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
C'mon.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Just reduced.
Isn't it?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Get on the other side of that.
Even better.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
I'd like you to see this.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
You sure?
Most people are afraid of death.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
You?
Leaving what?
If it came down to it what would you do?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
You got me.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
I'm interested in mythology.
I know.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
No.
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
I've seen it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
He will not stop until it is over.
Get out.
Conner?
Why?
What?  How?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
I can take care of myself.
No.
How can that be?
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
What will you do?
I think he's dead!
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Not if they're looking at something else.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
I don't know.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Whatever.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
She didn't answer.
What's wrong with the radio?
Stand by.
Order your men to stand down.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Yes, sir.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
Your phony FBI assholes.
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites?
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
The front gate would be best, General.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Bring back your policemen...
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Very soon.
I saw the sign.
Promoted. House Manager.
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What cards?
Move? Where to?
He wants your wisdom.
Please, be quiet.
We must do something.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
So where is the lamb?
Go out! Where?
No, no.
Yes.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen!
No.
I have to go to the Diplomat.
How dead?
How much beer?
The staff and guests! How many?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
It's complicated. But don't worry --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
I'm moved beyond words.
Yeah...something.
-- I'm sure you did.
Is she alright?
Yeah, me too.
Nothing.
Left, goddamnit!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
It's not going to let us out!
Up here --
Why not?
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
He's gotta still be down here.
It's succeeding!
Run.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
-- wit...nesses --
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
And then what happens?
-- even if I give you a million as well?
What?
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
-- I'm coming --
We don't have proof of that.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Well I bet you they're happy.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
So what are you saying?
Who?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
I'm ok.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Why?
Come back to us honey!
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
And what would you do?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Right.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Buying some drugs, alright?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you.
A prize?  For what?
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
But I said I was sorry....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Wha--
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Trust Leonardo....
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Remember that shoe you lost...
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Why George, you big softie...
The Hipster!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
Lumbago.
On Norville Barnes!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
I myself --
Oh, no, really, I --
...Why don't I just type this up...
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Your i --
Now, Aim --
As a three-dollar bill.
Sez who?
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I don't know...
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I'm sure you do.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
I --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Get up!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
But, sir! --
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Maybe he's wise.
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
But, Mrs. Rand --
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
That doesn't sound like him.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
You want that?
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
No thank you. We should be off.
Hmm. Good night.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
That one.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
If you're going to insult me --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Sure dad.
Stay out of trouble.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Mom. Are you ok?
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Oh Wendy.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Of course.
Social work?
Educated guess.
You ask what the point is?
Now you are being rude.
Ouch.
Do what?
Shit. You're not planning --
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
No one.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Geometry?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
I'm chewing.
There's a TV in the basement.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Hey Sandy.
Yeah? See ya.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
But there wasn't any...
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
Worth pursuing?
Byrd's dead.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
What time was that?
And something else that might interest you.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
That's right.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm not expecting anyone.
After that she left the party to go to him.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
Best friend?
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Oh?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Then there is nothing.
No, my beloved, my child.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
She is.
But why?
Yes... My God...
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I can't. Go away from me.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Yes.
Be still!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Give it to me!!!
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
It can't be...
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
But how do you know?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Lestat, what do you mean?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Yes.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
A child who can't die...
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Just kidding.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Yeah.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Why are you being like this?
Will you try...for me, please?
It's gonna be great.
Ben Willis.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
He's in it with Willis?
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
No. Yes?
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Not anymore.
Cool.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Well ——
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
That should decide it or you --
Miss Wollsten!
You wouldn't tell that ——
Theodosia.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
She's not too well.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
He hates all my race.
I can't do that. These families have children.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Don't . . . George?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Go through with what?
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Made what?
No, of course not.
Zuzu's petals.
Where is she?
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
Splendid! Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
What's that book you've got there?
They went out of business years ago.
Thanks.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Hi, Bert.
Of course it's the place.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Yes, sir.
Mother? What do you want?
It will?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Goodbye, Sam.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Came back three days ago.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Oh . . .
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Nothing.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Five hundred dollars.
Okay –– what can we lose?
Ummmmm . . .
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels –– the oldest champagne –– the richest caviar –– the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
George, darling! Where have you been?
What?
Oh, shucks . . .
How fast is enough?
I'm supposed to.
No problem, no problem.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
You bet.  Hang on....
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Every day?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Yeah?
It's okay.  What happened?
Sean's still out there.
What?
What else you got?
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
And sound.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Because they're playing our song.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Home it is.
What're you guys doing today?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Help!  Help!
I can't stop thinking!
What's that mean?
Huh?
Next week.
Anything.  Anything.
Mike?  Our Mike?
It'll be fun, come on!
I can go out if I want to.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Michael....
Go on, you're tired.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
See you later.
My imagination isn't that good.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Nothing.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Make up your mind.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
Here.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
No,  I'm not going through there.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
... Okay.
I am.  You're not.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
No!
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Some miss all their shots.
How'd it get in here?!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
I know.
Not good enough.
And alone.
That?
Aww, can't I keep it?
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Oh...
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
All right, hit those lights too.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Something wrong?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I'll be right there.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
But it went away...We would have known....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
I'm not doing anything.
You check it....
You can stay in my room.
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
It's not nice to be evasive.
You're damn right I'm serious....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
I'm fine....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
Why'd you take the boat?
You must get bored easily.
I'm sorry...I....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes I can....
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
You sure you know how to do this.
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Still chasing fish?
I wish there was something I could do....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Hey!
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
The shark will get it for us.
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
What do you know about him?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'Snuck up on me....'
Stop that!
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Here it comes....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Happy birthday, darling. ...
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Good night, Polly....
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
I think you're here all day.
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
I'm going up to the institute.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
No, Sir.
Once.
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Bullshit.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
No I'm not.
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
I'm blind because my father drank.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
Jerry!  Do something --
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Oh come on --
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Well, take care.
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Thanks.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Do you have something to drink?
We will be fine!
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Good night.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Tell me -- let me help --
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
How do I know?
No, I don't know.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Damn right.
What DO you stand for???
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Shut up!!!
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
What did you say?
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Eric!
Think.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
What about Eric?
DAD!
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
They're here.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
On the island.
I have never been on this island!
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Back out! Move!
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
It certainly does.
No.  I feel something.
Minimal.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
Not without a shot of the nest.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
You've broken its leg!
Oh, God.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
It has a broken leg!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
Are you insane?!
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Why?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Small versions of adults, honey.
Alan!
Anti-nature.
- - shut up.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Are they heavy?
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
That's a good idea.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Wu?
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
All night.
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Sure.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
Ken, we've been through this...
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I want to look at the rest of the house.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
What?
_Krueger_...
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
Oh?
Fascinating.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Ten minutes...
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Yes.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Yes.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
... All right.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
I -- I found your jailer.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Well -- other departments are, yes.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
... A piece of paper ...
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
What's to become of us now?
Amerika for us!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Father ... Father!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Native costume?
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Did he come around often?
Yes?
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Didn't want you.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
What was better? I made better bait?
No, that's not --
Like for you to look for the man.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
-- We can talk --
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Is that what you gave him?
Thanks.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
The same as Jane McKenna.
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
I was wondering what that was.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Where, how?
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
It's not so bad.
She told me.
No.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Good.  I'll see him in there.
The prospect of losing my child.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
What if she forgets?
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm sorry...
Uh huh?
You like it?
Is that really your chair?
Are you going to get remarried?
Why does he decide?
Like a principal?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Then I have concluded my questions.
Yes.  Very much.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
I...I don't know...
How long was that?
Yes.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
What?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Oh, no..
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No, but--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Things? What kind of things?
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
You're sure?
You and Charley?
Ted, I just heard...
Please, Thel...
Ha!  You tell me.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Can I free the prisoners?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
I miss him too.
The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Britain chooses not to.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
I had relinquished doubt.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
I have smarter men.
Pretend.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
Completely.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
No.  Do you?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Cocktail?
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Raincheck.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
We both know what they'll do.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Eh.  Fuck it.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Hector.
You think?
Obviously I was wrong!
You talk to the married couple?
Gee.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
She's worried about the cow now.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I'm not even a field person.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Wild guess.
Sometimes.
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Starling -
Oh.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Not yet.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Where?
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
By the book, he's a sadist.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
A cattle ranch?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
How would he test?
Yes, Doctor. Please.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Dr. Lecter -
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Yes, miss.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
What would you have me do?
My letter...
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
We were headed...
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Excuse me...
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Your enemy...
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
That's all, sir.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
By your leave, sir.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Fire!!!
Yes sir!
Fire!
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Be my guest.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Stay calm!
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
How much time does that give us?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's wrong with it?
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Roger.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I signed-up for the stock option.
What music?  There ain't no music.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I'll think of something, don't worry.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
That inspires confidence, that does.
It's a Samoan pub.
I don't know what you mean.
Good, you can get this under control now.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Jesus Christ!
All right, furry muff.
You had better be careful.
Try that one.
All right, Dad.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
Furry muff, let's go.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
And?
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
Well, perhaps you can help?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
I'll only be a minute.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
What about all the gear?
Er, well, twelve.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
I can't take any more school.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
No, sir. Not at all.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
You're dismissed.
I'm feeling okay--
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
I never met her.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
He does.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
You going to get married?
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
'57, 1 believe--
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
The Sheriff.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Why would I want to go there?
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Time marches on.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Are you okay?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Like your story is over.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
How 'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
You sell much out here?
You believe that?
You heard right.
That's so cool.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
I don't know.
It's him... it's him.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
You don't?
I think we make our own futures.
Why not?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
It was more than that, I think.
Stuff?
You said you weren't with him for love.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Yes.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
You can't.
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
I... have... to.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
Mine.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I tried to pay you off.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Yes...
At birth.  I don't know you --
Well... nobody.
How the fuck do you do that?
Nobody's better off this wav!
In my time, and nobody else's.
What?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...
Fuck you.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
It's Charlotte.
I see them every morning.
Really?
You're possessive.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
And marriage, does that get easier?
We established that we have no communication.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where'd you grow up?
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
Because that would be too easy.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Ok, well... I love you.
Tomorrow.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok.
Bye.
One moment.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
You wanna come?
Bye.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
When did they find her?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I found them in your file box.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
What did you hear?
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I had to.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
What do you mean?
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
It's Detective Smythe.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
He's looking right at me.
She told me she killed them.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
There you go.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Thanks.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
I know.  But chances are...
I don't like flowers.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Big-ass titties?
Good.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
You do see me standing here, right?
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
She understands.
You're not stupid.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Quincy...
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
What's up?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
I'm not asking for us to be together.
I don't think so.
You're what?
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
Few days ago.
We won the championship.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
We need to talk.
What?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What are you doing in my room?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
Don't sit down.
GET OUT.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
You just move in here?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
That's great, thank you.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Eight o'clock?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Bye.
So you've done it --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Claudia.
Cynthia?
Son, please, now....
Why the hell aren't you in school?
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I'm sick.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yes I do.
I need to sit down.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
She loves you.
-- memory?
...cocksucker....
Go fuck myself?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
Alright.  Thank you.
So boring, so useless --
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Well I guess it doesn't.
And your father?
From '84 to '89.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
About three weeks ago.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
What does it look like?
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Will that help?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Yes.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Well maybe.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I don't know....
I'm not through asking my questions.
Are you her boyfriend?
I'm Bob.
I'II go....is it...back here?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
I can't.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Do you have that?
That's it.
Thank you.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
You're late, not me.
Why did you do this?
Yes.
hang in there, ok. I love you.
Hi.
..sorry...
Hi.
I have money.
...what...?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Nothing... Nothing.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Yes, and he has a choice!
Three days.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
I know.  God go with you.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
Who does?
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Raoul --
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
... tired.  Must... lie down.
He is my brother.
I must insist, Sire.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
Every step of the way.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Where are you?
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Fine...
It wasn't in the cards.
He said he was following up some lead.
Who is it?
Yeah?
You're the mysterious type, right?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
No, but I'm listening.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
Found what?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
I killed them.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
How about Marvosa and the others?
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Then what did you do, play canasta?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
I don't recommend it.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Christ!
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
I have to.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
I won't be here.
There's no connection between the families.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
Have him peel the top label back.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
It'll do fine.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Who?
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you feel privileged?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
No.
Yes?
Yeah. It's right here.
No.
Hi, Linda. ..
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
I don't think I'll tell you.
Most people are.
Cut the general crap.
What happened to them?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
If I were?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
You haven't smoked in two years.
No.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Will...
Mama was probably asleep.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
That's right.
Go on to the house...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Stuart is fine.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Pray tell.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
That's interesting.
Fight what?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Tank you veddy much.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
Yeah...
Oh!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Ten.
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Hi... am I late?
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
They're asking for it.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's so dirty.
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
It is apparently not working.
So your name's not Gorsky.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
There!
Bob.
And you are?
What?
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
He had an accident.
Midnight watch.
Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
Really?
How many were there?
Cypher?
Just get me outta here.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
What do you know?
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
The Matrix?
When?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Because... I didn't think I would?
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
She helped you?
That's why we're here.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What do you mean, without him?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
That's different.
Should I be?
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, you're not.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Do what?
Where is it?
Hell yes!
The Oracle.
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Cypher, I thought --
I'll be all right.
Know where he is?
Look fella...this is private...
Uh...can we give you a check?
Salute!!!
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Not quite...but keep trying.
I don't like loading crates.
I could have told you that.
How?
Good idea.
No.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
C'mon Johnny.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Nothing.
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
 Shut up.
Come on.
Friends of yours Michael.
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
His wife?
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
We've got some things to discuss.
Who?
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
What will I tell Annie?
You mean this, sir?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Right away.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Am I not obligated to?
He'll wait --
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.
'Here'?
Of whom?
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
In my sleep.
Sounds good.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
You have a way with words.
As close as a deal could be.
For how long?  And why?
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Sure.
Jennifer.
Are you?
And you're a nice man, Quince.
How did you meet?
I am Joe.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
I don't mind --
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes...I've found that it does.
Has her pain abated?
No.
I am.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
And you can't tell me who you are.
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
-- Yes?
No.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
How long have I got?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
A 'deal'?
How about giving a guy a break?
Are you sad, Bill?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
That's okay.
Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
'Spooning'?
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Yes?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
No.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
And we're very grateful.
Thank you.
Of course.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
I think you know --
'The one' to do what?
I'm sorry --
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
Yeah.  I guess so.
You mean like you loved Mom?
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Then what is it?
It's something.
Joe?
Oh, yes --
You and 'Honey'?
I think I know her.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it?
That's it.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
When was I in here?
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
A cop?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Don't say anything else.
Quiet!
Take the money and walk away!
You know what we have in common?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
What?
I told him about your car.
Calls himself Dodd.
Help me.
Can I ask you something?
What are you here for?
Well, that's me.
Are you Teddy?
I'm not appealing the decision.
Then why are you here?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
You're in a playful mood.
Lenny, is that you?
Things change.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Who?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Why?
What sort of questions?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
But he's not the right guy!					  *
No, you won't.
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Sure.
I got to talk to my ADO...
Show me...?
I dance...
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Is this the protective male talk?
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
No.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Verdado where?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Never heard of him.
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
They had me from the gate.
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
What flowers?
Define small.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Do we need this...?
What...?
They lied.
The Statue of Liberty.
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
I know. Scribbage!
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Forget it.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
What of?
I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Hell, don't cry about it!
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
What?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
Get down -- where?
No. You got it.
...He had a bald skull and...
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Billy?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Where is it?
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
What is it? . . . Billy?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Mr. Yesil.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Did you ask for bail?
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
There's some weird shit here.
Take a look.
No, you talkin' at me.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
What do you-?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Don't get kinky here...
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Susan, we're not b-
It didn't bite me.
Just do it!!
I can.  We can do this...
No shit.
What do you want to know?
How long...?
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
My pleasure.
Yeah, thanks.
Yes.
I don't know.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Annie, what's the matter?
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
--not fair?
I can't write this anymore.
I said that?
A toast?
You really think so?
To Misery.
I think you're right.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
That'd be a first.
From her point of view or mine?
Where is it?
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Oh, I am.  Later..
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
..in the building...
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
I don't.
Can you think of a better one?
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
I'll muddle through.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
What did you think of him?
Not necessarily.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Very.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Yes, I gathered as much.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
I don't.  No exactly.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Nyah still on the property?
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Oh yeah?
Roger that.
What happened to Jim?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
What kind of help?
You don't think we're going to make it.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Why, may I ask?
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought I'd take some now.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
- and picked us up in the States -
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Whatís going to make him do that?
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
I usually am.
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
I don't know.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Twenty minutes.
Itís not working.
Run it through from the top.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
I want you to stop seeing her.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
Pop, I got news.
He got hit by a bus.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
In a month.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
You're my father.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
Hurry up.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Maybe I should come back another time.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Seven years ago.
Stupid yourself.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
A wolf without a foot!
Me neither.
I was dead, too.
Take it easy.
Oh no I didn't!
What?
How can you ask me that?
I'm here!
What!
Will you marry me.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Maybe you're right.
What do you mean?
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
Who is he?
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
No. But I have a hangover.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
You gotta date?
My mother's recovered.
No idea.
Sure!
That woman was a student of yours?
People home.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I knew she had it.
Burn them.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
We don't have a lord.
What?
I am your king!
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
We want ... a shrubbery!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Now - go!
None shall pass.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Come on you pansy!
What?
Stop that.
Had enough ... ?
Come, Patsy.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
A Grail?
You got us all worked up.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Yes.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Yes, Lord.
Course it's a good idea.
The nose?
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
And therefore?
I'm not dead!
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
They cost fifty pounds each!
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Rather what?
Well ... I'll tell you ...
No.  Until I come and get him.
We're coming with you.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Quick!
We'll cover your escape!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
It's too perilous.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
How about yourself?
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You watch your tongue.
Be careful who sees it.
Quite.
She's busy.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
The future King!
You'll talk when I'm finished!
How will I know what she requires?
Who'll bring it to me?
Occasionally.
I'm not married.
Oh.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
You are well?
She's well, too.
Yes, ma'am.
Those, over there, there.
I am told so.
Who by?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I heard something.
I'm breaking no promises!
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What is the matter with him?
How do you stop The Screamer?
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
I came from the city on the left.
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
I'm coming over.
Sure.
We can't...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
I don't know.
And beat it at it's own game.
I was afraid you'd say that.
What are you going to do?
Yeah.  The Inferno.
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Don't even say it.
Screamer.
And then keep on driving?
Not yet, honey...
So how do I start?
Give her a chance, will you?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
It's been a very strange day.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
I'll speak to someone.
How's that?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
But, this could be serious.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Okay.
Keep going. Go around to the back.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Yeah, what for?
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Could be unrelated.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No time. Get him up.
I'm not fucking him..
I don't know.
I'm leaving.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
I'm not listening.
I'm listening.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
Knock yourself out.
Yes, sir Mom. 
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Excuse me, sir ?
We will start work on it now sir.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir ?
He's been expecting you.
What did you hear ?
I was.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Aren't you the bitter one.
I don't know.....
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Yes.
Thank you.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
I don't even know your name.
I would do it again in a minute.
Pommeroy.
Well you know what I mean.
So, what's on your mind?
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Totally groovy huh?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
That's okay.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
Rose.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
There's water in your bathroom.
MOM!
No THANKS!
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
WHAT??
Why do you argue with everything I say?
You would.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
He is one of the great poets.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Boyfriend?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
This is a totally barbaric custom.
He's an undertaker.
Nick?
This has been a real confusing day.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Wow!
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Okay.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
Yes, I do.
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
This guy bonking you?
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
What Hurts Vada?
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
It's nice.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
In ages, I know, me neither.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Why?
Sorry.
Why not?
There were just too many of 'em.
What??
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Why?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Probably.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
My Dad was funny?
What are they about?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Hi.
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Goodnight.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
What are you saving for?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Never mind.
For their meat.
Bye Ma.
Okay, seeya.
I dunno..
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay, okay.
Kindred spirits.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
Go figure you.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
Sure.
Someday she'll thank you.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
... except one.
Ju...
Exactly what?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
She finds him "personable."
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
No.  I've got you.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Yes.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
... maybe it's congratulations.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
And your point?
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I know that, Star.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
No.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
What did you say your name was?
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
How come?
It's the den mother.
National?
Not yet.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
No.
Do you carry door handles?
Oh... Well.
He's a member of our congregation.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
I've got a gig tonight.
That's unkind.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
What...?  0h, yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
An album.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Just a minute.
What?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
No, we never did that
Oh --
Where are you from?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Ryan O'Neal.
You bet.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
More or less...
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Yes, you are.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Who is we?
Ain't love grand.
Whose ratings were higher?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Aside from the obvious?
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
NO!!!
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Survival of the fittest.
They actually apologized.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Thanks.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Okay.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
They done that too long in my family.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
No. You got the wrong idea.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Name's Duff.
Any other family?
Oh yeah? That's good.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
No.
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
What's he like?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Don't call them that.
Go on - hit me!
We'll be all right.
You will.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
There's nothing to say.
Yeah, see you in hell.
I'm Duff.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
No, thanks.
What did you say, boy?!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Who is?!
How are you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Oh yeah?
I'll be seeing you.
I know.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Let's stay here, Will.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Like hell you ain't!
Anything you say, baby.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
Since when?
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
Of course.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
What?
Very well.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Dixie McCoy
I've arranged for him to work with us.
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What about McCoy?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Can you walk?
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
No problem, amigo.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I don't know. I don't know...
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
What's my end?
Couple of months.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Shhh...
They'll cut you down.
I'll be okay.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
...And if I guess wrong?
Who?
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Sure. No problem.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Leave.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
I can't do this.
Yes, desperately.
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
I love the way she writes.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Why do you do that?
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Yeah, actually I do.
Wow. You believe in me that much--
What?
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Everybody knows about--
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
We can handle it.
I know.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Taste it.
Why not?
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Who's Lisa?
Oh, come on Dad...
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What do you mean?
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Why won't you talk to me?
I killed him!  I killed him!
Okay, I guess.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Can't it wait till morning?
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
You did it the other night.
Let's try this way.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Thank you.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Oh God.
Never been here before?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
We're gonna try.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
The truth.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Everybody take five.
Anything?
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
They used to keep a spare key.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Of course.
This is stupid.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
No.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Okay.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
That's fine.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
Why?
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Why?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
You have a stunt bottom?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
What?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
Well... how have you been?
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Right. 
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Do you want to stay?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Ah... yes, enormously.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
I suppose so.
Not classic, no.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I think you do, yes.
Really?
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, that is correct.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
I-I-I...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
No! No! No!
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
No way.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
So long, kid.
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Ca-na-da...
Come here!
Yeah!
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What for?
With your own two hands?
Okay, sucker.
Just warmin' up.
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
Hear what?
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
What is it?
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Oh, what was that?
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
I see...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Good. Good.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Shhh!
How do ya know that?
That right?
Come an' see.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Potential assaultive.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Asshole.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am...
That!
Is he one of the loonies?
You ol' fucker!
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Oh, yeah...
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Let's find a telephone.
You're sure...
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
Exactly.
No...
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You are leaving, aren't you?
To the foot doctor.
You didn't answer my question.
So it wasn't real.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Hi.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
What?
Well, not exactly...
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Oh, hello.
But somebody wrote those songs.
My God, you have...
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Maybe.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Oh.  Right.
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
I know, but...
...and a fortune teller.
You sure you'll be okay?
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
When you could've found one in America.
Giovanni.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
And you didn't tell her?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
Gimme.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
It's a living.
Mm—hmmm.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
I only live up there and across the roof.
What for?
I don't know.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What made you want to be a fighter?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Are you sure they're your friends?
My pigeons... .
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
You are like—
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
A question of who rides who.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
You'll work.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Looking for me?
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Forty-five bills.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Listen, Johnny—
One little dime you don't need.  I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint—  –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Keep Charley out of this.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Where?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
Tie them that they may watch.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Well then let us proceed.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
And the one driving the other car?
What?!
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Really.  Hm.
Who are you?
Yes.
You were his what, his box?
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
I'm a tourist.
Sure looks that way.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Or two.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
You know how I felt about her.
I don't know.
I don't ski.
And then they'll kill 'em.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Wait.  You not Adele?
What do you want to bet?
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
There a problem, Foley?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
We're leaving.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
I thought so, too.
Of course I am.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Shit...
None of your business.
That's my dad.
Think I could have them back?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
A girl.
You did?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
She did, huh.
He killed a police officer.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
You just did, for Christ sake.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
Looks like tonight.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
Glenn?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
What?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Can we change the subject?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You used to like it.
"Hey, yourself."
Off a tip?
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
So?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Likewise.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Nervous?
That's me, Sir.
Yes Sir.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Hale-what?
Where's that lizard?
He did.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
I didn't mean it.
Waitress!  Four beers!
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Yes you can.
Hang on.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
We can explain, Colonel.
Our doctor's gone too.
I was hoping to meet him.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
We're all going away.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
All of 'em.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Good—bye, Grandma.
Peggy Sue!
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
It's that jerk Walter.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I'm not going.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Come on, let's dance.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Let's go down to the basement.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
I just can't trust you anymore.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
What the hell is that?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
What would that be, sir?
Are you for real?
Have a nice day.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
What're you doing here anyway?
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
You think so?
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
The hat business is in trouble.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
For what?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You look exactly the same.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Give me some credit, will you?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Wait! I'll go with you!
I... um...
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
Yes... why?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Dies?
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
We're not skipping this treatment.
Ready for what, baby?
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
What have you prayed for?
I still am.
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Where's Dad?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
We won.
You're in trouble.
People who want to bend the rules...
Who?
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Yes, we did.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
<u>What</u>?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
But I just wanted to say --
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
One or two.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
It's starting....
I know what's in here!
Hey, me. Over here.
Shut up.
60 years ago.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
For now.
Rain.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Looks clear.
Not if I'm the one.
Nice embellishment.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Remembers what?
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Yo!
Him.
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Come on. Get me out of here.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
What about it?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Yeah?
I got one...
Over here!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Out there man - behind the log.
Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.  See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir... 
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
How do you do?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
I'm different. I like it fine.
They know you here--know your name.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
No use waiting, then.
From you, I like it.
This must have cost a fortune.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Do you have to leave the note?
You leave it.
If you're doing all this just for me.
That's right.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
So that I will never be found.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Ale. I don't mind.
Who told you I was married?
I've never been to Florida.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
They call me Jeff.
What will they do to you?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
You, Killaine?
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
If I can get off.
We do, when we get the chance.
I wouldn't know.
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Men like you don't need orders.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
How do you do, sir.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Yes, sir.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
Thanks.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Yes.
What went wrong?
Sit on that log, dear.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Very good.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Oh yes.
Far too long.
You're a piece of shit
Thanks.
What about the Cromwells?
They don't count.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Well, it's worth seeing.
You're so famous now.
Voila!
You'd look naked without one.
Promise?
No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Not yet.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Naw, you pull it!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Caught my first tube this morning.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Got it...
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
They took a left at the next light!
Meaning you were expendable.
You don't have to.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Mmmnnn...?
I think it's Hawkins.
He's not really my uncle.
You what?
You've got a lot of nerve.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
The price just went up to ten.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
What?  Why?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
I'm in town until Saturday.
Of course.  How much?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Please.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are you taking me!?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
What do you mean?
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Thank you.
Afternoon.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I pray for that.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
But I always eat like this.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Do you remember me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
You're a silly girl.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
Of course you will.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
What do I do?
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
Yeah. It's really good.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Sire.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Begin!
You're sure nobody's following us?
What?
You're that smart?
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
What are you saying?
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, it's quite possible.
What did I do?
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Only if we ask him.
What???
What is it?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vat about it?
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Got dag pa dig.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Wagner...
Heil you know who!
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
People can hear you.
I mean in show business.
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
How early?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
How did she pay you?
Not at all!
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
All right.
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
With the forty thousand dollars?
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
I was getting to that!
She haven't even called you?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
You've led a charmed life.
Where... can I stay?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Just wait here?
Sam.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
What makes you sound so certain?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Can you?
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
Why do you ask that?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I'm sorry.
No need to apologize...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Haven't any.
Shut up!
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
What--special autopsy?
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Yes!
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Well, I do say it.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
It happens that I'm the law.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
You give me a pain!
And they never proved anything against him.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Nope, I'm through!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Now don't that call for an extra!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Let it go.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Almost certain.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Cry-baby?
You weren't going with her?
Who'd steal her body?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
Darned if I don't! 
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Fire insurance!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes.
He can't hear you.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
I could go out of town.
Like now?
Is Rose here?
Where is she?
I am in awe of it, Mother.
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
There was this old man that ate his niece.
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But I don't know who they are.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Five hundred rabbits?
I do, too.
I don't know.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Yeah.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Buddy, that was my place.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
I... I'll get the grits.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Well, good night.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, no, sir.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
What's the use, there ain't none.
You mean a farm?
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Who cares?
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
Abe Lincoln...
She's fine, as if you cared.
Move it!
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Clench your teeth.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
You don't smoke.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
General Jim Beam, then.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
That's not true.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Sounds good.
Maybe it's enough.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
I can't do it, Ben.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Who are you?
As you wish.
Yes, my Master.
Fine. Together again, huh?
How are we doing?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
All right, hang on.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Your father?
So, you have accepted the truth.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yes.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
I've got something to say.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
You know this earth - this person.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
Morning after?
...Guess.
Do you have a phone?
You sure?
Don't tease me.
Yes.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...Yes --
Yeah...
Yeah, I can't beat him.
No... I can't!
Why?
Christ.
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
He got lucky.
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Fouls.
Where're you off to now?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
How 'bout some Cokes?
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Black market?
No -- Just me.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
What was I gonna say?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Ain't they?
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Freak luck for sure.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got a good mind for dates.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Would you keep goin'?
...Yeah.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Creed's great.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
What?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
It don't bother me none.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
...Tight.
...No.
To see ya train.
Maybe --
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Ask her...
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Wait here...
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
So what do you want me to do?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Aah!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Yeah, that's better.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
No, it's not.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah...
Good idea.
Only time will tell.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Am I like Such a fellow?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Hold Daughter!
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Farewell.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Speakest thou from thy heart?
What?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Is she a Capulet?
Do you really think so?
Well I don't!
And I don't believe you...
Who the fuck are you?
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Nothing.
From Interpol?
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Bad company...
What's that?
Of course.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
That's it.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Gets the job done.
Is that right?
My way is better.
What a surprise...
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I do.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
Gregor's cell phone...
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
How could you have done that?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
I guess that's for the best.
Seamus Reilly.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I hear you.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
He saw everything!
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
What are you thinking?
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
No.  Why?
You mean that guy was an agent?
What for?
Nothing.
I love you too.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
What?
This just might be our ticket!
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Did you say After Midnight?
Well I don't know...
Uh...C?
What?
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
Is that the mail?
Are you hungry?
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
There was more than that.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got my sources.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
No.  It's my first time.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I'm calling for back up!
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
What the hell is going on here?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
IT IS CRAZY!
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
How do you know he's our man?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Gimme the binoculars.
What?
There's people up here!
It's a bomb.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
It doesn't matter.
Yes.  We have heaven.
Steamed dumplings?
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
I did!
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Amen to that, brother.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Baby Duck?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Any leads?
The Secret Service?  Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
The police can protect you.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Sir, I can explain.
A little.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
You know him?
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
How much they want?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Or somethin'.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Ambassador Han.
Can I speak with her?
Yes.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
After I left?
I'm not running.
You bet ya, Coach.
"Sink the putt."
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Seven-fifty.
You know, there's no...
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
I don't and I don't think you should...
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
And the church.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
I'm just finishing up, too.
No.  It's my life.
That's good.
It sounds nice.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Am I what they had in mind?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Listen to this, I love this part --
I know.
Becky?
I know. 
Come on, Jonah --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Walter and I are engaged!
Destiny takes a hand.
What?
Like... clockwork.
Hello.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Have you had any relationship since?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
She died.
Fair enough.
No.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Good.
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
That's true.  Why is that?
Victoria? She's okay.
Yes.
Did not.
It was all they had.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Who? A scab?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Yes. We will light the candles.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
No.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
Not even a guess?
You like that?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
How?
How far out of town?
What is wrong with you?
Therapy session is over.
I just can't. Okay?
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I don't want to.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
Guess it's our turn.
Midnight?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Can your man handle that?
10%.  That's ...
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You're going to have to explain that one.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Hey, I don't play that.
What?!
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Bubba.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
I thought you'd be happy.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Keep trying.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Those guns are close.
But, sir...
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
You?  Leading a squad?
Fresh out.
Since when have things been normal?
Three for three.
I'll be alright.
Let's just find someplace.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
And how do you bluff yourself?
You're welcome, John.
Yes, sir.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Get back to your positions!
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Frogs?
What about you, Captain?
Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
That's right.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
I hope you understand.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
I'll be home soon.
But you never had a first date.
I'm gonna call her.
Come on, it's graduation.
Wait a minute.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Oh yeah!
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
I love you dad.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Okay, I give up.
I know that.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
What?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Today is tomorrow.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Okay, bye.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
No.
Then why are you shaking?
Well, I need to study, and...
Did you talk to Corey?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
How do you pay for one of those?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Are you?
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
I called her up.
Alright!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
In Breslau.
They're not gone, they're here.
Look -
You did, but you didn't.
Yeah, okay.
Things are great, things are great.
How do you do?
They should be.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
They're withholding payment.
There will be generations because of what you did.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
We're aware of that.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
Let us decide that.
No, it's not.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I got it..
He hates Oliver Stone.
Miss Weathers.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Hallie?
Let's find out.
Over here.
C'mon. Let's go.
No, wait here.
You're getting obvious.
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
Hello?  Hello?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
What about rehearsal?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
But...
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I don't know.
Thanks.
What kind of a game?
Good bye Ben.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Bitch.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
GALE WATCHOUT!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Who's this?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Who the fuck is this?
Sorry.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You sleep in THAT?
What's that?
It's been a year since she died.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
What?
I called my dad.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Who is this?
What's that noise?
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Come on, yes you do.
I can't think.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
What brings you out to these parts?
Then what are you doing here?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Yes, you doofus.
At the airport.
Yeah.
Should I be worried?
How is everything?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
I told you to send it back.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Right here.
What am I doing?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Sleep tight, sweetie.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Wanna another beer?
They think it's school-related?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I bet he's pissed.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
TATUM!
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Tits -- see.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Murderers?
What the fuck is going on?
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Can we talk about this in private?
Hello.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
And, if it's a threat.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Totally unrelated victims.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
We'll tag along.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
And so what?
What?  Assessing fines?
We need a warrant.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Slut.
I can't let you do this...
Oh... um, William.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
You should look into private schools.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Yes, sir...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Why?
Good night.
What's that?
But I just bought a good blanket.
Cut it out, will ya...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Never heard of him...
Not no more.
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
I got your boy killed.
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
But couldn't you...?
Oh God, Tommi...
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
I just had a really strange experience.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Thank you.
1976.  What happened back then?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
I've killed my husband!
Yes, something was...
The title won't do.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Right you are, governor!
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
The title?
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
I did not.
No, it will turn out well.
How goes it, Will?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Good title.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
"Madam!"
"Madam!"
"She speaks.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I'll be damned if you are!
Can you love a player?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
My lord.
Virginia?!
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
A man, my lord?
I don't have time.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
No.
Juliet?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
About the mail --
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Well?
This is just an informal discussion.
Well, yes.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
Now?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
What?
I don't thinkI can.
OK.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
And the money?
Now you thought of that, not me.
It's the only way.
I see.
What?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
What about?
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, nothing, sorry.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
Two hundred pounds?
That's what it cost, David.
No.
I should hope so.
And you need your sleep.
What?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Sorry?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
I'm boring?
That guy, the one that died.
Here?.
Would you like to see the rest?
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
I write about it?
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
No.
What're you talking about, George?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
What are you talking about?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
I don't know.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
You're looking great, baby.
I hope she's all right.
... what?...
No.
No.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
No.
I am not like my mother!
Great.
You do know what money's like these days.
They are?
Yes, Buffums.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
Can't you do it out here?
No, I'm sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Did Lester know about him?
Hey, I don't tell.
You did, didn't you?
-- we can't now.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
Me?
-- yes, you --
-- you've got to leave.
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
Wash her.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- please, please forgive me...
What're you talking about?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
George, I don't --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
How?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
What!
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Hey, I'm, you know --
I already said hello.
When is that, George?
What?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- well aren't you --
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
What is.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
George, now cut this out.
Said what!
Thank you.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
See she doesn't drink too much.
Isn't that bad for it?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Okay, thanks.
I know.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Come on by.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Sid.
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Of course not.
What's that?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Does she know about us?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
I'll call you.
Fine.
George is great but I know what you mean.
But you have problems?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
How much?
Jackie --
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Thank you.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yeah.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Talking to Tony.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Yes, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
Grady... oh.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
I did?
Pleasure to meet you.
Your money's no good here.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Hmm, nice.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Yes, I did.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Jack, stay away from me!
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
I'm intrigued.
Well, my predecessor in this job
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
Sure, Uncle Al.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
What if it's some kind of monster?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I told you!
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Oh?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
I think they hear you!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
This prom is a real drag.
Oh my! 
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
I know.  It's ancient.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
It's true -- I know her.
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Enough jabber.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
What?
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
They're from my old convent.
Don't you know it!
I see.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
A what?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I must go where I can be of use.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
You saved my life.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Get a stenographer.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Yeah, like what?
Oh-huh.
A hiding place.
You won't even tell us?
Who are you guys?
So, take it off.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We're losing it.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Impossible.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
... Brom Bones...
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
They need guidance.
Pardon me?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Well... that might be... helpful.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Small talk.
Must I hear this?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
Just... keep where you are.
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Yes, actually.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
No.  She has gone out.
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
May I see my mother?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
You got any money?
That boy wants me to.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
They was a boy. We made friends.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
No sir.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
You believe in the Bible?
Childers.
What numbers do you punch?
I aim to kill you with it.
What are all them books?
They let you out?
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Naw.
Why not? It died?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Yes sir.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Naw.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
I didn't aim to.
Okay.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
So, you're really going to stay here?
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Okay.
Can I help you, sir?
I know.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
It's my birthday.
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
And your father? Is he from New York?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
The Queen of England?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Ah-hah.
I'm all ears.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
It means "happiness."
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
So I can get my job back.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
He's dead?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
No way.
The end.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
You don't.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Closer to eight.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
The Japs did it.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
Yes, he was.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
I'll take two.  One for later.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Obviously.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
That's all he said.
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.

It's private.  Go away.
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
Tore off one of my chests.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
You - you -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
What happened?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
Vanity Fair?
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You don't say.
You must be quite a girl.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
This is where I get off.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
We can have it altered.
It doesn't matter.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Why?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Yes, we're the new girls.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Brains aren't everything.
About what?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
You have a yacht?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
What a beautiful fish.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Talk about sad.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
What else is there for me? 
Thank you.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I know.  Every time!
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Hey.
Still--
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Last night?
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
She did?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Shampoo, got it!
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
But nothing did.
Ahoy!
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Just drunk enough.
Hard.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
She was dirty and wet...
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
I don't look like no possum!
Goodnight.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Same as we -- they pray.
Children, come here...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Is he gon' be gone long?
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
Mornin'...
But, Nathan--
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
Eric!
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
That book wasn't Canadian!
Okay.
And she's getting worse...
Your behind?
What Cartman?!
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
A hunger strike? For what?
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Do as I say, Kyle!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Guess.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
That's gonna take a long time!
Yeah!
Our moms suck!
I don't know, dude.
Yes?
Oh God... What have I done...
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Don't believe the hype!!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Hey, come here, guy.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Hey, relax guy!
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
And the butfor?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Oh yeah...
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Look answer my question!
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
What is the condition of the bridge?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Great.
Why can't we?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Sure.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Words to live by.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
It would matter to us.
That is one of my priorities.
Where's Taylor?
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
How am I supposed to know?
The engines!
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Can I get you something for the road?
Lemme see your ball.
See ya 'round Faz.
Wish me luck.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I found dad.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Who's there?
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
I like the sport the way it is.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Yippy!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
The Peter Pan.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Can I ask you something personal?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
I can't tell you, Theo.
We would have sooner or later.
You should.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Can you change something this big?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Open it, Captain!
Two and a half days?
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Press?  No, I haven't.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
You don't want to know.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
What the hell is going on here?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
You don't know that.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
She wired this system.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What -- are you threatening me?
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
What?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You told him about me?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
In case you die, too?
Still clear.
He what?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
You think?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Sintag.
Nothing about drowsiness.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Antihistamine.  For bites.
It's a soporific.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
Where are you?
Your watch.
You think I'd really drink that?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
I promise --
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Leave me alone, Norman.
What?
Beth --
Get away --
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
What?
I'm fine.
Our present.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Her suit's gone.
I thought she was with you.
How do we decode it?
I don't think so.
Shut up and open the door.
Her legs are in the way.
No idea.
Wait!
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
Beth and Harry?
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Please, Ted.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
That's where my father was killed.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Was this trip really necessary?
It's automatic.
You don't believe in the Force?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
We'll send a squad up.
With four casualties?!
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
He'll be well cared for.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
What an honor...
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Not enough, I guess.
Yes, sir !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
So ?
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Yeah.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Zander, no...!
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
You two have so much in common.
I'll go for that.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Flip six, three hole.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Doesn't look like it to me.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
To join with him.
Who is V'ger?
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker... ?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Nope.
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Who?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
You quit.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's in your play.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
But why the dalmation?
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
As the Old Mill goes around...
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
Goodbye.
Me?
You got a paperclip?
Would you go in...
Oh, God...
The other side.
Then I'll come back, then.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
...take <u>any</u> two people...
What?
I'd love to.
Sleep well?
Yes...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
Drama Group?
We had a date.
We did...?
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
And I need a drink.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Now: I'm looking at the...
They think it's your First Wife...
Bourbon and Milk.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
No, you're absolutely r...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
There's other things to be learned.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
I, actually yes.
That's my...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...yes...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Marty...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
That's cor...
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Mmmm.  You have children?
My wife just went into labor...
Who's White...?
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
I'm gonna nail it.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
So be it.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
If you do the product placement...
He's got a gift for fiction.
George, that is so kind of you.
So we just got lucky.
Mmm...
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
What are you gonna talk about?
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Don't. Take me with you.
Until he's old enough to read.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
But Rache...
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Rache can do that part.
So where are you?
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Something's up wi...
You think I didn't get that?
Rachel's not half my age.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
A lot smaller.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What did you do?
But it's not on the schedule!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I need practice.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
I don't, but...
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
Brad Kovitsky.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Is that what he told you?
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
Jesus.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I know that.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Like what?
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
I'm still poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No.
You have a bay?
I am sure.
Nothing, I guess…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Is everything OK?
Fine.
I can read it to you.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
I'm going in there.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Can I join you?
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
I hate reading.
Hello, is this Pam?
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Oh, that's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Is it loaded?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Doubt it.
He did?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
What the hell is it, anyhow?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
There's enough in one vial...
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
That's government property, Major.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Do you recognize my voice?
You're right, sir.
Who do you think you're talking to?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Where, sir?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
Have you tried the recall again?
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Roger. One-three-eight.
They're moving apart.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Why should they call us back?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Sorry, King.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Maybe the warning system's out.
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Knock yourself out.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Yes.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, no.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
Yeah.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
I know, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
Wait. Hey, man.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
In what way?
Yeah?
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Glad it's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Oh, So what about her?
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You could do it.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
You rich?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Thank you.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Good. That's good.
Well, w-what happened?
Yes.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Will you just put the gun down?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Seven-twenty.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Look, why do you care, huh?
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Like what?
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
I would've stopped it.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
New ground?
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Oh, yeah?
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Please. Look...
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Like?
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Mine too.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
You do?
Really? What else does your mother say?
Oh, How'd she get back?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
It's none of my business?
Hey, Tim.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Positive.
Jack...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
My best friend got pregnant.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
That was the general idea.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Thank you.
I had a teacher like that once.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I tell you this is half sold.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Come on in, Betty,
This is where you live?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Get out.
I will not have it butchered.
What month?
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
I need some money right now.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
You think this is all very funny.
A little.
What's that?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
She is upstairs.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
What is it?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
It's a warning, that's for sure.
It's for your own protection.
I have to.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Tell me where I can find her.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
But what if---it wasn't real?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
And you think you're in love.
Why should I believe you?
I don't know. You seem afraid.
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
You bet your ass.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
You're not...an orphan are you?
But what for?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
That's home.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
I seem to be.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
It sure is.
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Oh...I came close once.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Well, aren't you excited?
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
What!
At one o'clock in the morning?
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Nope, but --
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say who?
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
Turn on the T.V.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
For what?
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
What about me?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
53!
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Missing????
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Where did it come from?
Yeah. I'll check.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Actually, yes.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
We'd better talk.
Let's go to my place.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
I think he said a "curl."
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.

Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Zod.  Zod.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Like me?
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
A toupee that flies?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
There!
First, I have fun.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Well!
No.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Big night coming up?
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Of this...Superman.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
You're on.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
And if I don't obey?
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
-- as we will be.
He'll be weightless.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
How old are you?
Uh-huh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
Then...when did she get better?
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
No you don't.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Just like we look forward to this.
Good night.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why did you do that, Billy?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
From what?
That's right.
What's that, Dolores?
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that?  Billy?
Isn't it a lovely day?
That's what he said.
Nicole?
Okay.
I won't lie.
I'm absolutely positive.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
She...she was a friend of mine.
That's the local bar?
Indian?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
I need money.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
You remember this?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Very slick.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
Great.
The Ottos.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Is it news to you?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Why?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
I don't believe it.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
I didn't say that, J.J.
I'll listen one more minute.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
Get Steve back his job...please...
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
But not for anything I did today...
You're incapable of the truth...
What about?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
In his apartment -
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
But...
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
What ship?
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
What chip?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Why?
Right.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
No.
No problemo.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
I know, Mom.  I know.
Go!  I'll finish here.
So do you.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.
Relax now, Sarah --
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Yes.
Five minutes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
We're dealing with degenerates here.
And your father was executed.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What's in those files?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Why were they going to arrest you?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Then you are wrong.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
I have no idea.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
How could I forget?
So. You wanted to see me.
Nope.
They said I was dogged?
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Wrong.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Great.
What's it to ya?
Kyle.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
You must have had a fun child-
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Kyle...
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I just called.
Admittedly...
I said I was sorry...
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
It was a gift... from my brother.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
You first.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
It's okay, dad.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Wha... ?
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Who's responsible?!
Where'd you get that gun?
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Stop talking to them!
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Single?
Always.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
It's a profound life experience.
Are you still on mediction?
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Slow down, take a breath...
Okay... okay.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Humor me with specifics.
Physical?
It's all down to this...
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
What's this about?
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
You get your money.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
You could have.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
How could you do this to people?
Yes.
Why?
Mrs. Dudley.
So far.
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
No one will come any nearer than that.
Fifteen dollars.
It's all I could afford.
You're okay.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I do.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Because --
There's been some trouble downtown.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
This ain't your lot?
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Probably.
Hard to miss.
No, why did you come here?
Weren't you on a television series?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
He give me your address.
What line is he in.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Right.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Why not.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
So what's your beef, pal?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Hey.
Yeah.
So what.
I don't get it.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
I don't.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
Oh, Mr Crane--
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
...Uh-huh.
Birdy--
Ah.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
Ed.
Cash.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
OK.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Honey?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...OK.
So... who... who actually--
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Huh?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
Birdy...
You also have an interest in the securing property?
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Under arrest for murder.
Calm down.  I found it!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Where's the head?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Correct.
The sub-basement?
Got my hands full here.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not giving up.
You must.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Don't stop now.
Read it out loud.
Yes.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
They were yellow!
Holy mother, what is that?
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Frock's been fired.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
It's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
And John?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
A monster?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
Then it won't go after the others?
For what?
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Oh God!  Help!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
You want to book the flight?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
He gave it back to his father.
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.

They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Shhh!
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
So when are you leaving?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
This is where it started.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
The thing that started all of this.
It's a surprise.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
--we need more charcoal.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
--Darling--
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
I don't understand.
Good.  Good.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
You're not FBI agents.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Nothing completely conclusive --
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
There are complications.
Kurtzweil, we think.
No. Don't bother.
You a reporter?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You can't.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
What happened to playing a hunch?
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Where are you, Mulder?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
I was until about an hour ago.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
How was it contracted?
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Mulder --
Very weird.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
How deep does this go?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
I don't want to find out.
I'd be there for him.
What then?
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Yep.  Eloped.
I bet we can fix it.
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Sometime yesterday morning.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
What about narcotics?
I doubt that.
You're looking well.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Do you understand German?
Dr. Winkel told me that.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
He liked to laugh.
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Yes.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Good-bye.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
No, not yet.
No.
He was...
You're not locking her up?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Which side of the road?
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I want to talk to you.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
What's the name of this girl?
I understand...
In great pain?
Must be some mistake.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Now, hold on.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
Yes.
Oh.
Traveler.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
What!
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Disease? What disease?
Is he a Nazi?
No.
That's stupid.
The sex is better.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
V'asitem...
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
I don't know. Is that right?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Of course they're Jews.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
No.
What were you, following me?
I thought you hated Torah.
This is me.
You're lying.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Steve's going to explain it.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
I've got to get back to the --
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Christ...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
They're not that Jewish.
What?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
And let us say...
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Johana, am I boring you?
He seems to have won it.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
What else is there?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won't, I swear.
That idiot!
Then tell him to wax it too.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
No!  I would never cheat you.
Tea... or whiskey?
We saw each other a little while ago.
My wallet.
I did?
Then, tell me a story.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Again?
What?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
In the spring when he melts!
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
... Yes?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's your first move?
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
It's Esther.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
Oh!
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Take a look.
Resting?
That depends. How much money has he?
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
You really think so, Charlie?
Sure.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Tomorrow -—
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
That was unfortunate.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Get it out of here!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
And did you find the leopard?
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
That depends what you’re looking at.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
You drive a hard bargain.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
No!
My brother hung himself.
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Croissants. Like that...
Yeah.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Don’t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
How much of a hurry are you in?
I see. How much?
You... Fuck you!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
...On holiday?
Where are we?
Where is it?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Oh... We split up.
Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
I hope it’s not too significant.
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
Jah...
We conclude our transaction.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Have you?
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
Shut up!
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
No...
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
Then why don’t you reach him?
I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.
Why did you kill him?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Huh. I’m a businessman. What are you, eh?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Costliest!
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Now?
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Scared of a girl?
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
Who are you?
How old are you?
Were you baptized?
What did it tell you?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
The other half.
Yes... they were.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Yes, it's a miracle.
Yes.  We can pray.
Good idea...
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
I... submit to Our Lord.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Don't swear...
I said, kneel!
How many did he give you?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What for?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
He's still a doctor.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
It's nothing.
Wladek, please.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He'll be here soon.
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Here.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Can you help?
Can you help us?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
Toilets?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Dirty pig!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
I've been worried sick.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Yes, it's unholy.
I'll be back.
I miss you.
The piano.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It must come.
You've missed this bit.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
What's the line on Visitation?
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Don't worry about it, pal.
All of it.
I think it's the best...
That's the way I want it.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Lonnegan after you, too?
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
And?
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Raise 500.
You're more gutless than I thought.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Where's June today?
Sixty-five.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
So could Shaw.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
I don't know, figure something out.
No.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Come on, gimme a break.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Don't cry.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Oh, here she is.
Then what are you hiding?
And I'll give then proof!
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Where did you hit her?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
He's been dead for three months.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Where are you going?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.
Not at all.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Was there much blood?
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
No.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Rosebreen.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Well, what?
Tell 'em.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
I'll get some.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
Just what I said I'd do.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
No.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Take it easy.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
I'll get some towels. 
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Your guess is as good as mine.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Goodbye, darling.
I did find him!
Sure.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Yes!
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi...
I wish you'd tell me.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Yes.  Nick!
I just wanted to tell you...
Baghdad.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
I heard!
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
Wes--
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
What are you doing?
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Roger that.
Wh-what do you think--
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
He's not going to leave us.
We'll find our way.
We can't just leave him.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Shoot them!
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
I don't know!
Really?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
We have to do something.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Violation?
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
You've seen enough.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
Don't take anything.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
No one can see us now we're alone.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Not very encouraging.
I want you for my roommate.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Too late....stay close.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
You don't know that!
Where's LUH?
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Damn.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
I don't know. You tell me?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Would you?
Me, too.
Stay to your left.
It's from an IRA.
We work fast enough for you?
Hey, I'm next.
Stay here.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
I know.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
Amsterdam?
You're looking fine, Major.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron?
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You say I am a crook.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
Gaston!
The six--
But it's not enough!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What's wrong now?
Yes.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
As you like. 
Yes!
Right!
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Um-hum ...
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
Then why do you want to go?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
I know!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
May I?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
I don't want your money!
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Well, he was in the navy.
Didn't you take it with you?
That's right.
Thank you, Rose.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
Don't you mean work me?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
Excuse me.
No you won't.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Sure. If you like.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
Now it's worse.
I know, I know.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Never let go.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
It would be a nice change from you.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
I'll join you later.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
Nice lines--
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
There's soft music--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Don't rub it in.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
But--
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Jimmy!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Shortie, look!
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
Sure.
Send that.
Next month is June.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Knots!
Yes--Me--in person!
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Miss Marsh.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Yes!
Are you happy?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
I'm getting seasick--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Why don't you leave me alone?
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Not a chance--I'm through. 
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Sure, Sis.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Come and get him.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
But wait, you don't understand-
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
In pace requiescat.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
I'll remember you said that.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
That's great coming from you.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I don't.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Good God, you're really-
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
I need it.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
So he can tell the story.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Fine.  Better.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
That a fact?
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
And still not a thing to watch.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Where can I find him?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Shhhhh...
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
Well... If you insist.
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
I see...
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Of course.
I didn't think so.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
Nice to run into you again.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
... We have time for that?
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
And number two?
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
My timing always was lousy.
You disappoint me, Number Three.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe I can get down there next week.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
He will be alright.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I'm busy.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
It's only a tale.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Those boys never did have good luck.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
Country people got so many strange ways,
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I was just trying to make conversation.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, yeah!
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Let's let Molly open one.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Yes Sir!
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
What's with him?
Everyone, it's Woody!
I can't see a thing!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
Look!  Janie!
No she's NOT --
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
I can't quite make out -- 
No, Slink --
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I like plaits.
Didn't you know he made things?
Home is where the heart is.
In my pocket.
So did I.
Juliet who?
Victoria -
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
What?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
She asked me not to.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Is this bad for him?
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Not Tiger Woods.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
You will dine with me from now on.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
What's he doing up here?
Who?
We agree.
If I can.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
What do you mean?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
I guess you would, Franco.
Thanks.
Where are you going, Diane?
Great.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
It's Iggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
There's no need.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Spud, they're my sheets.
And you might get the fucking job.
Try this.
Lewis Gilbert.
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
I don't rate that at all.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
What's wrong, Allison?
When are you going to visit him?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
We're two thousand short.
Are you serious?
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Sure.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Pavel.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
What is it you seek?
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Fascinating.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
I gotta sit down.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Now learn something about yourself.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.

I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
No. You must kill me.
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Hi, Flynn.
I want to go to his place.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oh. Anything else?
Yes, okay, exactement!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
User requests are what computers are for.
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it -- ?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Do it!
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Okay.  Here she comes.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
You know about that?
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
I wasn't cheating!
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Okay.
Yeah.  It was great.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
What about Juno?
Do you still love me?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Go ahead.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Yes.  Go ahead.
What is it you need me to do?
We're going to Paris?
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
No.  He checked out okay--
What letter?
You can't have just one.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Tell me about yourself.
What do you want to know?
Almost four years.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Who and what is a Drexl?
A real live pimp?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
What did he do to Arlene?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Why?
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
You got it.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
In case.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Really?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Get on your knees.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
She seems very nice.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
I believe he believes him.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
That's bullshit.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Underground.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
July.
No, 1995 is the past.
No more drugs.  Please...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Lock it now!
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
Flowers!  What flowers?
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
I'll be right here...just in case.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
What?  What did you say?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
You don't fear death?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You son of a bitch!
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yeah, but it was shot.
You got the money?
You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Genuine Draft?
Yeah, I'll try.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
I think I burned my gun hand!
John . . .
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
They look nice.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
That's all right.  I got it.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
What do you do anyway?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
What?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Jake.
You live pretty good.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I wanted to talk.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I don't know.
Where are you going?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Give him the money.
He was going to--
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Can you climb back up.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
What for?
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Would you kill her?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Talk?  About what?
About what you said this morning.
I did?
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
Is the job done?
The time wasn't right.
You know what I mean.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
But, Senor--
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I think I've heard that before.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
You've got to be--
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
What makes you say that?
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I got it.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Walk away.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I don't know about that?
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
'Cause I love you.
Get in.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
There's someone in the house.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Oh.
What was that?
Think carefully?
What about the game?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
I mean if you knew karate?
I lied.
Two hundred and seventy.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
On a bench, across the street.
I fined 'em instead.
Innocent of what?
Thank God.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
He give 'em names?
That big guy lookin' for me?
Oh. Yeah.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Your wife?
Yeah, I guess.
Property.
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
I could run off them whores.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Duke.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
Give it to him.
I could of... easy.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Been gone near three years now.
Shut up, Kid.
Yup.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Sure. Sure, Bill.
Yeah.
HEY, KID.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Two more hogs got the fever.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
He's blind, for Chri...
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
That was your idea, I wanted to...
We done that stuff.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
Who ?
They want more time to think about investing.
Alright.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Edie, please.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
You are a criminal.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
What time is it?
You know damn well, dead-man.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
What?
Kobayashi.
He didn't have my lawyer.
He loved her.
Kobayashi.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?
Wait a minute.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I never heard of him.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
You thought it was just.
What is the truth?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
That's right.
Tell us.
No.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
You may step down.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
'Code Blue'...
The Doctors were not negligent.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Yes.  I wrote it.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
... and you're going to do that?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Then why don't you testify?
Why is that?
Defense...?
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Are you done?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
Missus...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What happened...?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
It's over!
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
What do you want?
Don't touch anything.
...I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
I'm going to get laid.
They still have to take it to a jury.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
What did she do?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't know.
... I understand ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
Should I?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
From whom?
No.
No.
Yes.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
You won't have to.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Judy Barton.
I want to know who you are.
Why?
Why?!
But Scottie, you don't have to!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
To complete my cure.
We're going up the tower.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Where?
Home?
Yesterday.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
Yes --
Too late... there's something I must do...
Please let me go.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
What a pleasant hobby.
Well?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
That!?!
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Do you know him well?
Carlotta?
Where?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
What is it, a still life?
But you said grey, sir.
I thought so!
Can we have it by tonight?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
You're an asshole.
The hell I don't.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
Calling the ambulance.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
So I didn't fucking do it!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
What?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
I can't do this.
They won't figure it out.
There is no candy!
I know...
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Well, oh...
Where is she?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Who?
The groom?
Not tonight.
Left side.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What is the question you asked me?
Just do it.
What does that mean?
You're sick.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Goosed!
We missed the deadline.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
What else have you forgot?
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
What are you talking about?
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
He's weird.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Of course.
You go down there.
Do you love me?
Hi.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Yeah. Nesting.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Well, can you come back inside?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
Like how?
Move the bodies.
I just want her to be happy.
He's your brother.
Come on.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
How do you know she's dead.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Downstairs in the closet.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, the children sleep with me.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Was that difficult to get?
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Thank you, Uncle.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
But why? Why?
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
Why?
Are you Jorge?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Leave him alone.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
She's left.
What's he called?
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Where?
I had so many things to think about!
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
When you are, miss.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Have I slept long?
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
That's not true, Parker.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
It's the White House.
For Schumann.
...can we have a white one...?
...and...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Who's got the story? 
All I need is the one day.
And you?
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
The American "people"?
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
You're tired, Ronnie.
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
The War is Over.
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Could we have you in here, please...7
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
My name is Ronald Brean.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
...Good...
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
...that's what it is.
W...what?
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
An anti-psychotic...
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
You got a dime....?
...one more day.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Watch me.
Take ten.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
No, he's back in Nashville.
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
...you take that Anacott Steel?
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Coulda been a contender.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
What if they call him?
You sure?
I don't know anything!
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So what firm you with, pal?
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Allright. Wait here...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
I don't.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Why?
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't...and I won't.
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Right behind you.
Six six and six
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
What do you mean?
A ghost?
No.  But once I heard...
Then we both are.
Do you really think so?
Yes, but...
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Who?  Your husband?
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
I should be going anyway.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
This is...
...just so she could cut them off.
Good.  I'm good.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good.  So you're human.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Shhh.
M-E...
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
I was down in Adamant...
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
All of us.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Don't.
Three o'clock.
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
I know.
I'll be there.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Mmnph.
Unless you need me to come home...
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Well, that's nice.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What's going on, Claire?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
...like it never even happened...
Well, that's a relief.
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
I felt you...looking through me...
In the living room...
But I don't remember.
It's Madison Fra--
It's too rough.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
That's not what I'm sayi--
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Claire...
What?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Nothing.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
:Would you stop it!
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Help us.  Do what you can.
Like this...?
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
You bastard...
To love, you must be able to feel.
I bring her flowers too.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I love Michael...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
The one time I want it to work...
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Hello..
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Your beneficence.
A bit much.    Lucas.
Stop it!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
He's got great hands.
Is that what you were doing...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
That's right...
Yes - I have had it for years.
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
then why did you marry her -
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Open it...
What's this all about?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
No - a dentist
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I better go, Dad.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Let me get this straight...
So you'll think about it?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Yeah? You like?
We love our lives just the way they are.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
I will not have my boys arguing.
Some of them have to be automatics.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
What do you want me to do?
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
I understand.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
My new bike.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
He didn't. He had it built.
Eventually you'll let go.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Maybe someday.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Forget the store. Think big.
Rules are rules.
You called the cops on us?
As much as possible.
Tipping?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
You think we should be more open minded?
Really? So I'm doing OK?
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
Kelly.
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
And the child...
I know you do.
Then what?
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Ray thinks she was murdered.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
We don't know that, Ray...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Where's this coming from?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Your Honor... Please...
What?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
You notice my new jumper?
No you don't.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
God, I've been calling you.
You think that's wise?
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
No.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny.  So am I.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
You need that real often?
Always hoping.  Or this...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Try what?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Hey, I tried the board.
Well... that, too.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
My pleasure.
What is this?  A whole new train?
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Your guests, ma'am?
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I've had some practice.
You bring the best out in a man.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
That'll be all, boys.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Is this what's left of your army?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Say what?
I love you.
Madmartigan.
I will!  But I need help!
Miserable Pecks.
I have to give this baby to some- body.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
Who?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Watch it!
No!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Me!
Why?
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
How are we going to get out there?
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Cows. You know, cows?
Sorry. It's important.
Pretty much.
Pick up the hat.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Just us.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Move! Or you die right here!
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
You couldn't wait until morning?
But why?
But –
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Can I have something to drink?
No. I'd want a public phone.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
I hear you.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
You shame yourself.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
All right, where is he?
You might have killed him!
They are English. They don't understand.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
You'll be hist...
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
What's she doing now?
Oil can....
Oh...
Oh --!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
You're right -- I am a coward.
The nerve.
But why?  Why?
Oh, come on.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Did I scare you?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Dorothy next!
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here --   Come on.
Imposserous!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Yeah.
Emerald City!
Yes.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh, dear, dear.
We'll get you together!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh, no!
Yeah --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
So who are you?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Alright then, brunch.
She’s not a girl anymore.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Consider me ungrateful.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
You’re not going to.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Where did you get this?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
C-class.
Please.
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Washington?
Wrong answers?
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Hello, Adrian.
What's your theory?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
You -- you know about me and Dan?
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
She's with me.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Antarctica??
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
That's because --
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What do you mean, frame-up?
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
-- What?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
What is this place?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Go to hell.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
They come in any other styles or colors?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You're serious?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
Had to do what I had to do.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He's busy right now.
He takes his work seriously.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What do you want?
Who?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
How?
ALIVE.
It does indeed, Max.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Victor Frankenstein.
Poppycock!
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Yes, sir.
What?
I hope you like large weddings.
Whatever makes you happy.
Goodbye, darling!
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
What wockers?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Yes, Master!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Well...
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think I'll...carry him.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Nor to Elizabeth.
But, after all, you have yours.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Four
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Certainly, Sin
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
